12 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>A scoffer does not love one who corrects him</strong></span>,
Nor will he go to the wise.

31 The ear that hears the rebukes of life
Will abide among the wise.

<strong>Proverbs 15:32</strong>

32 He who <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>disdains instruction despises his own soul</strong></span>,
But he who heeds rebuke gets understanding.

<strong>Proverbs 16:22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22 Understanding is a wellspring of life to him who has it.
But the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>correction</strong></span> of fools is folly.
