<strong>Proverbs 29:27</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

27 An unjust man is an <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>abomination</strong> </span>to the righteous,
And he who is upright in the way is an <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>abomination</strong> </span>to the wicked.
