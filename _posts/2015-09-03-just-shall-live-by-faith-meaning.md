<h2>"Just shall live by Faith" Original Verse</h2>
<strong>Habakkuk 2:1-4</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

2 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me </strong></span><strong>(</strong><strong>Shulamite woman waiting for her husband in Song of Songs, in the tower)</strong>, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.

2 And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>run</strong> </span>that readeth it.

3 For the vision is yet for an <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>appointed time</strong></span>, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>wait for it</strong></span>; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>just shall live by his faith</strong></span>.
<h3>Live by Faith means</h3>
In its context,
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>WAIT FOR THE LORD</strong></span></li>
	<li>"I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me"</li>
	<li>Find Jesus in the verse</li>
	<li>Eagerly wait for the Lord to talk to you through Bible Verses, Anointed messages where Jesus is the centre focus ( NOT U )</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Write the Vision</li>
	<li>Make it plain ( easy to understand )</li>
</ol>
that he may <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>run</strong> </span>( NOT WALK ) that readeth it
<h4>Paul's AIM to <span style="color: #800080;">RUN</span></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Run means, Get your Job Accomplished</li>
</ul>
<strong>Galatians 5:7, 16</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

<span id="en-KJV-29170" class="text Gal-5-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Ye did <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>run</strong> </span>well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?</span>

<sup class="versenum">16 </sup>This I say then, <strong>Walk</strong> in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
<ul>
	<li>Paul's first priority is to run, so then Paul encourage them to walk first.</li>
</ul>
<strong>2 Timothy 4:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-29878" class="text 2Tim-4-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>race</strong></span>, I have kept the faith.</span>
<h3>Resulting</h3>
<ul>

	<li>First part of the verse says about proud person and the contradiction with the faith.</li>
	<li>Proud is not of faith</li>
	<li>Great faith people: Centurion and the Woman who's daughter is demon processed were so humble</li>
</ul>
