<strong>Proverbs 26:3-12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 A whip for the horse,
A bridle for the donkey,
And a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>rod for the foolâ€™s back</strong></span>.
4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
Lest you also be like him.
5 Answer a fool according to his folly,
Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
6 He who sends a message by the hand of a fool
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Cuts off his own feet and drinks violence</strong></span>.
7 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Like the legs of the lame that hang limp</strong></span>
Is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
8 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Like one who binds a stone in a sling</strong></span>
Is he who gives honor to a fool.
9 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard</strong></span>
Is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
10 The great God who formed everything
Gives the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>fool his hire</strong></span> and the transgressor his wages.
11 As a dog returns to his own vomit,
So a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>fool repeats his folly</strong></span>.
12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?
There is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>more hope for a fool than for him</strong></span>.
