<h3>Isaiah 45:23-24</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

24 Surely, shall <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #964cb2;"><strong>one say</strong></span>, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #964cb2;"><strong>all</strong></span> that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.</blockquote>
<h2>How?</h2>
<h3>For Whom?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Person who say "I am the Righteousness of God in Christ".</li>
	<li>Person who finds strength in Jesus</li>
	<li>Person who say "I became Righteous Not by My good deeds", but by Jesus Righteousness.</li>
	<li>Person who believes on Christ and on what He did on the cross.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Result</h3>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #964cb2;"><strong>ALL</strong></span> who incensed against you shall be ashamed
