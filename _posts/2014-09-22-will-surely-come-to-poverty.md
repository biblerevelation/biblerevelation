<strong>Proverbs 22:16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who oppresses the poor to increase his riches</strong></span>,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>he who gives to the rich</strong></span>, will surely come to poverty.
