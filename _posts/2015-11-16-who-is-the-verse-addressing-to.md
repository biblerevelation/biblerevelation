<h2><strong>Paul</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Paul calls all Believers as Brothers</li>
	<li>Paul never used to call non-ChristiansÂ as brother, on all his epistles</li>
	<li>Because Paul's ministry is to the Gentiles</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Peter, James and John</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Peter, James and John mention Jews as their Brothers</li>
	<li>They mention Believers as BELOVED Brothers</li>
	<li>Other mention to Belivers: Little Children</li>
	<li>Because Peter, James and John's Ministry is to the Jews</li>
</ul>
