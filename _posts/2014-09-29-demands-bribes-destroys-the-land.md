<strong>Proverbs 29:4</strong>

<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
4 The king establishes the land by justice,
But he who receives bribes overthrows it.

<strong>New International Version</strong>
4 By justice a king gives a country stability, but those who are greedy for bribes tear it down.

<strong>New Living Translation</strong>
4 A just king gives stability to his nation, but <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>one who demands bribes destroys it</strong></span>.
