<strong>Hebrews 4:1-4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Promise of Rest</strong>

4 Therefore, since a promise remains of entering <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>His rest, let us fear</strong></span> lest any of you seem to have come short of it.

2 For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>not being mixed with faith</strong></span> in those who <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>heard</strong> </span>it.

3 For <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">we who have believed</span> do enter that rest</strong></span>, as He has said:

“So I swore in My wrath,
‘They shall not enter My rest,’”

although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 4 For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”;
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">we who have believed</span> do enter that rest</strong></span></h2>
<h2>Confirmation that he has entered into his rest</h2>
<strong>Hebrews 4:9-11</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ceased from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> own works</strong></span>, as God did from his.
11 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest</strong></span>, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
<ul>
	<li>Rest means Belief</li>
	<li>No Rest means Unbelief</li>
	<li>Man should cease from <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>his</strong></span> own work</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He that is entered into his rest, he also hath</strong></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ceased from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> own works</strong></span></h2>
