<h2>Lay Hands. That's it</h2>
<blockquote>Bible didn't say Lay Hands and pray</blockquote>
<h2>Mark 16:17-18</h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; 18 they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover</strong></span>.‚Äù
<h2>Mark 6:5</h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 Now He could do no mighty work there, except that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them</strong></span>.
