If we accept Jesus as our Personal Savior that He died for #ALL our sins, We are #IN Christ Jesus
<blockquote>in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HIM (Jesus)</strong></span> All Promises are<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YES only</strong></span></blockquote>
<h3>2 Corinthians 1:18-20</h3>
New King James Version (NKJV)

18 But <i>as</i> God <i>is</i> faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No.

19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me, Silvanus, and Timothy—was not Yes and No, but in Him was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yes</strong></span>.

20 For #<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>all</strong> </span>the promises of God in Him <i>are</i> #<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yes</strong></span>, and in Him #<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Amen</strong></span>, to the glory of God through us.
