<strong>Proverbs 10:15</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>The rich man’s wealth is his strong city</strong></span>;
The destruction of the poor is their poverty.

<strong>Proverbs 18:11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>The rich man’s wealth is his strong city</strong></span>,
And like a high wall in his own esteem.
