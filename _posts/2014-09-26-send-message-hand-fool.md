<strong>Proverbs 26:6-9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 He who sends a message by the hand of a fool
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Cuts off his own feet and drinks violence</strong></span>.
7 Like the legs of the lame that hang limp
Is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
8 Like one who binds a stone in a sling
Is he who gives honor to a fool.
9 Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard
Is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
