<p style="font-style: inherit;">New International Version (NIV)</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-style: inherit;">13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</p>
<p style="font-style: inherit;">14 Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.</p>

<h3 style="font-style: inherit;">Mark 11:20-22</h3>
<p style="font-style: inherit;">New International Version (NIV)</p>

</div>
<div style="font-style: inherit;">
<blockquote>
<p style="font-style: inherit;">20 In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</p>
<p style="font-style: inherit;">21 Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!”</p>
<p style="font-style: inherit;">22 “Have faith in God,” Jesus answered.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Jesus Curses a fig tree, because it didn't bring forth any fruit</h2>
<h2>Fig Tree represents Self Righteousness</h2>
<ul>
	<li style="font-style: inherit;">It started in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Even took Fig leaves to cover their nakedness, once after they sin</li>
	<li style="font-style: inherit;">Jesus curses a fig tree</li>
	<li style="font-style: inherit;">All sinners received healing from Jesus, except pharisees and Sadducees who believed on Self righteousness by keeping the commandments / law</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Very clear that, Self Righteousness won't provide any fruits as required ( fruits of the Spirit )</span></h2>
