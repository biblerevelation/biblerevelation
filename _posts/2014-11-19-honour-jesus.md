<h2>Looking at the bright side</h2>
<ul>
	<li>God doesn't want you to look at the dark side</li>
	<li>Your eye is evil and dark</li>
	<li>Your whole body is full of darkness</li>
	<li>Start looking at the bright side</li>
	<li>You have been redeemed</li>
	<li>Jesus died for you to give you the good life</li>
	<li>He was in darkness so your mind can be in the light</li>
	<li>Start looking at light</li>
	<li>Start seeing everything in the light</li>
	<li>Live in the light</li>
	<li>Expect good things to happen, just as you have expected bad things to happen</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can we expect Good?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus took your bad</li>
	<li>So you can expect the good He deserves</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can we honour Jesus?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Expect good and you honour what he did</li>
	<li>Expect miracles and you honour what he did</li>
	<li>Expect health and healing and you honour what he did</li>
	<li>Expect the Good life and you give glory to the one who did all for you</li>
</ul>
