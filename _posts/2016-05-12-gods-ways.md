<h2><strong>"My Rest" is the Land</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>It doesn't say "My Land" because people were walking towards Canaan</li>

<ul>

<h2><strong>This is not God' ways</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>What is an evil heart?</strong></h2>
<ul>

 	<li>You are not trying to take your healing</li>
 	<li>The devil is trying to take your healing.</li>
