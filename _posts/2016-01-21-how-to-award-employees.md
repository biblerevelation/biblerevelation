<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">1 Corinthians 15:10
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-28729" class="text 1Cor-15-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>not in vain</strong></span>; but <strong>I labored more abundantly</strong> than they all, yet not I, but<span style="color: #800080;"><strong> the grace of God</strong></span> <i>which was</i> with me.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Access based on results</li>
	<li>God Gives grace. The people who use that grace will be more productive
<ul>
	<li>For those who use that Grace which God gave, means that the grace didn't go in vein.</li>
	<li>Paul didn't use the grace in vein</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>God Gives grace in various ways
<ul>
	<li>The grace of Good colleagues</li>
	<li>The grace of Good company</li>
	<li>The grace of Good Clients</li>
	<li>The grace of Good resources</li>
	<li>The grace of Good Manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Works reflects whether the grace has been used in your life.</li>
	<li>Flow with Grace</li>
	<li>Use the Grace</li>
	<li>God rewards you for using that grace which He first gave you</li>
	<li>Award them based on their results</li>
</ul>
