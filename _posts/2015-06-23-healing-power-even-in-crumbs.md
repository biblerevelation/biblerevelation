<h2>A Gentile Shows Her Faith</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Matthew 15:21-28</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s2">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>21 </b></span><span class="s2">Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. </span><span class="s3"><b>22 </b></span><span class="s2">And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>23 </b></span><span class="s2">But He answered her not a word.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, “Send her away, for she cries out after us.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>24 </b></span><span class="s2">But He answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>25 </b></span><span class="s2">Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>26 </b></span><span class="s2">But He answered and said, “It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw <i>it</i> to the little dogs.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>27 </b></span><span class="s2">And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>little dogs eat the crumbs</strong></span> which fall from their masters’ table.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>28 </b></span><span class="s2">Then Jesus answered and said to her, “<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>O woman, great <i>is</i> your faith</strong></span>! Let it be to you as you desire.” And <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>her daughter was healed from that very hour</strong></span>.</span></p>
