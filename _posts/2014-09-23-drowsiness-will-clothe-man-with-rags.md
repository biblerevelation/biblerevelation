<strong>Proverbs 23:19-21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

19 Hear, my son, and be wise;
And guide your heart in the way.
20 Do not mix with winebibbers,
Or with gluttonous eaters of meat;
21 For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>drowsiness will clothe a man with rags</strong></span>.
