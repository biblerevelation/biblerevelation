<strong>Proverbs 16:27-30</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

27 An ungodly man digs up evil,
And it is on his lips like a burning fire.
28 A perverse man sows strife,
And a whisperer separates the best of friends.
29 A <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">violent man </span></strong>entices his neighbor,
And leads him in a way that is not good.
30 He winks his eye to devise perverse things;
He purses his lips and brings about evil.
