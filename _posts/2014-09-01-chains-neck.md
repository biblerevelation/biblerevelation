Proverbs 1:8-9
New King James Version (NKJV)
<blockquote>8 My son, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>hear the instruction of your father</strong></span>,
And <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">do not forsake the law of your mother</span></strong>;

9 For they will be a <span style="color: #000000;">graceful ornament on your head</span>,
And <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>chains about your neck</strong></span>.</blockquote>
