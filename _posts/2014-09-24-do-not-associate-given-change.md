<strong>Proverbs 24:21-22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 My son, fear the Lord and the king;
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not associate with those given to change</strong></span>;
22 For their calamity will rise suddenly,
And who knows the ruin those two can bring?

<strong>New International Version</strong>
for those two will send sudden destruction on them, and who knows what calamities they can bring?

<strong>New Living Translation</strong>
22 for disaster will hit them suddenly. Who knows what punishment will come from the LORD and the king?
