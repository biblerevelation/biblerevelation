<strong>Malachi 4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h3><strong>The Great Day of God</strong></h3>
1 “For behold, the day is coming,
Burning like an oven,
And all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.
And the day which is coming shall burn them up,”
Says the Lord of hosts,
“That will leave them neither root nor branch.

2 But to you who fear My name
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The Sun of Righteousness</strong> </span>shall arise
With healing in His wings;
And you shall go out
And grow fat like stall-fed calves.

3 You shall trample the wicked,
For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet
On the day that I do this,”
Says the Lord of hosts.

<strong>Zechariah 14:4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 And in that day <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives</strong></span>,
Which faces Jerusalem on the east.
And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two,
From east to west,
Making a very large valley;
Half of the mountain shall move toward the north
And half of it toward the south.
