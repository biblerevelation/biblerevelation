<h2>John's Prayer</h2>
<h3>3 John 1:2</h3>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

2 Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>be in health</strong></span>, just as your <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>soul</strong></span> prospers.
<ul>
	<li>Not only for soul prosperity, but also health</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The moment we realize God is for us to heal us, we receive healing</blockquote>
<h2>Jesus Cleanses a Leper</h2>
<h3>Luke 5:12-13</h3>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text Luke-5-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on <i>his</i> face and implored Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-25121" class="text Luke-5-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Then He put out <i>His</i> hand and touched him, saying, <span class="woj">“<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I am willing</strong></span>; be cleansed.”</span>Immediately the leprosy left him.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus is same yesterday, today and forever</li>
</ul>
