<h2 class="passage-display"><strong>About 1 John 1</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li class="passage-display">1 John 1 was written to Gnostic Jews
<ul>
 	<li class="passage-display">Who don't believe that Jesus came in Flesh</li>
 	<li class="passage-display">( Believers, As an act of believing, they take part in Holy Communion showing that Jesus came in flesh )</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>1 John 2 starts with my Little Children - That is the place John is addressing the Believers.</li>
 	<li>Even from the divine order of the bible we can clearly come to a conclusion that Peter, James and John's letters should be read with extra understanding as it is talking to the Believers among the Jews
<ul>
 	<li>Divine order is that the Letter's of Peter, James and John comes after the Letter's of Paul and also it comes towards the end of the bible.</li>
 	<li>End of the bible spiritually implies, towards the end of the world, towards end days</li>
 	<li>From the order, Paul's letters represents the time period of the Church. After the rapture of the Church, the Jews play a major role because they will go through the days of tribulation. That's why the Letters of Peter, James and John are towards the end of the bible.
<ul>
 	<li>Start of the bible : Genesis : Beginning of the world</li>
 	<li>Middle of the Bible : Matthew, Mark, Luke, John : Birth of Jesus Christ : History gets divided</li>
 	<li>End of the Bible : Peter, James, John, Revelation : End times</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>1 John talks about light and love
<ul>
 	<li>High Priest is also about Light and Perfection</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 class="passage-display"><strong>Walking in the Light</strong></h2>
<p class="passage-display"><strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">1 John 1:5-7
</span><span class="passage-display-version">World English Bible (WEB)</span></strong></p>
<span id="en-WEB-30547" class="text 1John-1-5"><span class="versenum">5 </span>This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. </span><span id="en-WEB-30548" class="text 1John-1-6"><span class="versenum">6 </span>If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don’t tell the truth. </span><span id="en-WEB-30549" class="text 1John-1-7"><span class="versenum">7 </span>But if we <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>walk in the light</strong></span>, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin</strong></span>.</span>
<ul>
 	<li>People used to think walking in light means doing bad deeds --&gt; That is not this verse is saying
<ul>
 	<li>We are completely against doing bad deeds, but this verse is not saying about bad deeds</li>
 	<li>Consider, "walking in light" means doing good deeds(no sins), then why do you need <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>blood to cleanse your sins</strong></span> ( when you don't have any sins, because you are doing only good deeds ;) )</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Cleanses</strong></span> : Active Tense
<ul>
 	<li>Continuous cleansing</li>
 	<li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Ridley_Havergal unveiled this truth during her life time which empowered her
<ul>
 	<li>Without knowing this truth , despite she know all new Testament verses it brought her in to a bondage, of trying to work towards Gods favour and mercy, when she already had it in the first place and it doesn't depends on your deeds. Its a Gift, not a reward. And His blood continuously cleanses.</li>
