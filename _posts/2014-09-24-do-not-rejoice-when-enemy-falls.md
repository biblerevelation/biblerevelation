<strong>Proverbs 24:17-20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not rejoice when your enemy falls</strong></span>,
And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles;
18 Lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him,
And He turn away His wrath from him.
19 Do not fret because of evildoers,
Nor be envious of the wicked;
20 For there will be no prospect for the evil man;
The lamp of the wicked will be put out.
