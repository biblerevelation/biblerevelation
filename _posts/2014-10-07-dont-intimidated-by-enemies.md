28 and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God.

28 without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved--and that by God.

<strong>New Living Translation</strong>
28 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Don't be intimidated in any way by your enemies</strong></span>. This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved, even by God himself.

<strong>English Standard Version</strong>
28 and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.
