<strong>Proverbs 22:6</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Train up a child in the way he should go</strong></span>,
And when he is old he will not depart from it.

<strong>Proverbs 22:15</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child</strong></span>;
The <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>rod of correction</strong></span> will drive it far from him.

<strong>Proverbs 23:13-14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not withhold correction</strong></span> from a child,
For if you beat him with a rod, he will not die.
14 You shall beat him with a rod,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>deliver his soul from hell</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 29:15</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>The rod and rebuke give wisdom</strong></span>,
But a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.

<strong>Proverbs 29:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Correct your son</strong></span>, and he will give you <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">rest</span></strong>;
Yes, he will give <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">delight to your soul</span></strong>.

<strong>Proverbs 13:24</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who spares his rod hates his son</strong></span>,
But he who loves him disciplines him promptly.
