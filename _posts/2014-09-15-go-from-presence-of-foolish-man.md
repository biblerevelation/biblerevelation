<strong>Proverbs 14:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Go from the presence of a foolish man</strong></span>,
When you do not perceive in him the lips of knowledge.
<h2>How to know if he is foolish?</h2>
You do <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>not</strong> </span>perceive in him the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>lips of knowledge</strong></span>
