<div class="heading passage-class-0" style="color: #5c1101;">
<h3>Numbers 12:6-8</h3>
<p class="txt-sm">English Standard Version (ESV)</p>

</div>
<div class="passage version-ESV result-text-style-normal text-html " style="color: #000000;">

<span id="en-ESV-4066" class="text Num-12-6"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">6 </span>And he said, “Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream.</span>

<span id="en-ESV-4067" class="text Num-12-7"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">7 </span>Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house.</span>

<span id="en-ESV-4068" class="text Num-12-8"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">8 </span>With him <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>not in riddles</span></span></span></span>, and he beholds the form of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”</span>

*he = Lord
<h2>To a prophet</h2>
<ul>
	<li>the Lord make himself known to him in a vision</li>
	<li>the Lord speak with him in a dream</li>
</ul>
<h2>To a Faithful person (Lord's servant)</h2>
<h3>Faithful persons are more prioritized</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Moses being faithful in all of Lord's house</li>
	<li>Lord speaks with him mouth to mouth</li>
	<li>Lord speaks with him clearly</li>
	<li>Lord speaks with him <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">not in riddles</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>The fact is, we are already made Righteous through the Blood of Jesus Christ</h3>
Now, the Lord see's us as His servant, a faithful in all His house
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">So, the Lord speaks with us mouth to mouth, clearly and not in riddles</span></h2>
