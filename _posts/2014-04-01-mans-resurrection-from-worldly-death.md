<h3>John 11:20-27</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

<div>
<blockquote>20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet Him, while Mary remained sitting in the house.

21 Martha then said to Jesus, Master, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.

22 And even now I know that whatever You ask from God, He will grant it to You.

23 Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.

24 Martha replied, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>last day</strong></span>.

25 Jesus said to her, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life</strong></span>. <strong><span style="color: #008000;">Whoever believes in (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on) Me, although he may die, yet he shall live</span></strong>;

26 And<span style="color: #af50ab;"><strong> whoever continues to live and believes in (has faith in, cleaves to, and relies on) Me shall never [actually] die at all</strong></span>. Do you believe this?

27 She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed [I do believe] that You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One), the Son of God, [even He] Who was to come into the world. [It is for Your coming that the world has waited.]</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Whoever believes in (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on) Me, although he may die, yet he shall live</span></strong> : Jesus is telling about Lazarus</li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #af50ab;">Whoever continues to live and believes in (has faith in, cleaves to, and relies on) Me shall never [actually] die at all</span></strong> : This is for us : He is talking about worldly death ( more info below)</li>

<blockquote>24 Martha replied, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;"><strong>last day</strong></span>.

25a Jesus said to her, I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life.</blockquote>
<h2>Resurrection is Here NOW:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>From the above verse, It's very clear that this resurrection and death conversation things which would happen before the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;"><strong>end of the world</strong></span></li>
	<li>Thus It's very clear that this conversation is all about Worldly death, worldly resurrection and worldly living forever.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life</li>
	<li>Jesus is the Resurrection and the Life</li>
