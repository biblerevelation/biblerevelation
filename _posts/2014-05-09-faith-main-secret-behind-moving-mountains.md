<h3>Matthew 17:14-20</h3>
<p class="txt-sm">New King James Version (NKJV)</p>

</div>
<div class="passage version-NKJV result-text-style-normal text-html " style="color: #000000;">
<h3><span id="en-NKJV-23715" class="text Matt-17-14">A Boy Is Healed</span></h3>
<blockquote><span class="text Matt-17-14"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">14 </span>And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying, </span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23716" class="text Matt-17-15"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">15 </span>“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. </span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23717" class="text Matt-17-16"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">16 </span>So I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not cure him.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23718" class="text Matt-17-17"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">17 </span>Then Jesus answered and said, <span class="woj">“O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.”</span> </span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23719" class="text Matt-17-18"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">18 </span>And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23720" class="text Matt-17-19"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">19 </span>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23721" class="text Matt-17-20"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">20 </span>So Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">“Because of your <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>unbelief</strong></span>;</span><span class="woj"> for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.</span></span></blockquote>
<h2>Answer:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Faith is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> the main secret</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>UNBELIEF</strong></span><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> </strong></span>is the main secret</li>
	<li>It clearly says, <strong>even if we have little faith</strong> we can move the mountain</li>
	<li>But <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we need to have 100% belief</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Unbelief of what?</h2>
The Truth
