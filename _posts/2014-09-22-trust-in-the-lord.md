<strong>Proverbs 22:17-19</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h2>Sayings of the Wise</h2>
17 Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise,
And apply your heart to my knowledge;
18 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you;
Let them all be fixed upon your lips,
19 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>So that your trust may be in the Lord</strong></span>;
I have instructed you today, even you.
