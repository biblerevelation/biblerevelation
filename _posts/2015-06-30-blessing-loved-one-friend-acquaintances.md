<h2>David prophesy about Jesus about His Crucifixion</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Loved one was put far from Jesus</li>
	<li>Friend was put far from Jesus</li>
	<li>Acquaintances into darkness</li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>SO THAT, YOU AND ME CAN HAVE Loved one, friend and acquaintances</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<strong>Psalm 88:18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

18 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Loved one and friend</strong></span> You have put far from me,
And my <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>acquaintances</strong></span> into darkness.
