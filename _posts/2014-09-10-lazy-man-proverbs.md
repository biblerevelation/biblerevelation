<strong>Proverbs 6:6-11</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Folly of Indolence</strong>

6 Go to the ant, you sluggard!
Consider her ways and be wise,
7 Which, having no captain,
Overseer or ruler,
8 Provides her supplies in the summer,
And gathers her food in the harvest.
9 How long will you slumber, O sluggard?
When will you rise from your sleep?
10 A little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to sleep—
11 So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler,
And your need like an armed man.

<strong>Proverbs 10:4-5</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 He who has a slack hand becomes poor,
But the hand of the diligent makes rich.
5 He who gathers in summer is a wise son;
He who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.

<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

26 As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,
So is the lazy man to those who send him.

But he who follows frivolity is devoid of understanding.

But the lazy man will be put to forced labor.

But diligence is man’s precious possession.

But the soul of the diligent shall be made rich.

23 In all labor there is profit,
But idle chatter leads only to poverty.

19 The way of the lazy man is like a hedge of thorns,
But the way of the upright is a highway.

9 He who is slothful in his work
Is a brother to him who is a great destroyer.

And an idle person will suffer hunger.

And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.

Open your eyes, and you will be satisfied with bread.

For his hands refuse to labor.
26 He covets greedily all day long,
But the righteous gives and does not spare.

13 The lazy man says, “There is a lion outside!
I shall be slain in the streets!”

<strong>Proverbs 24:30-34</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

30 I went by the field of the lazy man,
And by the vineyard of the man devoid of understanding;
31 And there it was, all overgrown with thorns;
Its surface was covered with nettles;
Its stone wall was broken down.
32 When I saw it, I considered it well;
I looked on it and received instruction:
33 A little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to rest;
34 So shall your poverty come like a prowler,
And your need like an armed man.

<strong>Proverbs 26:13-16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 The lazy man says, “There is a lion in the road!
A fierce lion is in the streets!”
14 As a door turns on its hinges,
So does the lazy man on his bed.
15 The lazy man buries his hand in the bowl;[a]
It wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.
16 The lazy man is wiser in his own eyes
Than seven men who can answer sensibly.

<strong>Proverbs 28:19</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

19 He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,
But he who follows frivolity will have poverty enough!
