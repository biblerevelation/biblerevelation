<strong>Proverbs 11:10-11</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 When it goes well with the righteous, the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>city rejoices</strong></span>;
And when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.

11 By the blessing of the upright the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>city is exalted</strong></span>,
But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
