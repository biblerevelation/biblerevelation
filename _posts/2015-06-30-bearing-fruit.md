<strong>Romans 7:4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another—to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>bear fruit</strong></span> to God.

<strong>John 15:4-5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me.

5 “I am the vine, you are the branches. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>He who <span style="color: #ff00ff;">abides in Me</span></strong></span>, and I in him, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>bears much fruit</strong></span>; for without Me you can do nothing.
