<h2>Zacchaeus the Tax Collector, Full Story</h2>
<strong>Luke 19:1-10</strong>
<strong> New International Version (NIV)</strong>

19 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. 2 A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. 3 He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>he was short</strong></span> he could not see over the crowd. 4 So he ran ahead and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>climbed a sycamore-fig tree</strong></span> to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>see him</strong></span>, since Jesus was coming that way.

5 When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.” 6 So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.

7 All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sinner</strong></span>.”
<blockquote>8 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>give</strong></span> half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>pay back</strong></span> four times the amount.”</blockquote>
9 Jesus said to him, “Today <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>salvation</strong></span> has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
