<h2>Approval from the Father in heaven</h2>
<strong>Matthew 3:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-23210" class="text Matt-3-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>And suddenly a voice <i>came</i> from heaven, saying, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</strong></span>.”</span>

<strong>Note:</strong> At this time Jesus haven't even performed one miracle, but still the Lord spoke about Jesus “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
<h3>Resulted in Jesus Overcoming Temptations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>As a result, Jesus overcame the temptations of the devil ( the <em>lust</em> of the <em>flesh</em>; the <em>lust</em> of the eyes; the <em>pride of life )</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Non Approval of Manoah ( Samson's Father )</h2>
<strong>Judges 13:22-23</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-6907" class="text Judg-13-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>And Manoah said to his wife, “<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>We shall surely die</strong></span>, because we have seen God!”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-6908" class="text Judg-13-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>But his wife said to him, “If the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these <i>things,</i> nor would He have told us <i>such things</i> as these at this time.”</span>
<ul>
	<li>Manoah, himself was a fearful person</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resulted in Samson's failure</h3>
