<strong>Matthew 6:25-34</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Do Not Worry</strong>

25 “Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?</strong></span> 26 Look at the birds of the air, for they <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns</strong></span>; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?

28 “So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>neither toil nor spin</strong></span>; 29 and yet I say to you that even <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Solomon</strong> </span>in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven</strong></span>, will He not much more clothe you, O <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>you of little faith</strong></span>?

31 “Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things</strong></span>. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be <span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>added</strong> </span>to you. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
<ul>
	<li>High Quality Life : Happy Life</li>
	<li>High Quality body : Healthy Life</li>
	<li>Stature : Growth or Increase in Years</li>
</ul>
<strong>Worldly Life</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Sow</li>
	<li>Reap</li>
	<li>Gather into Barns</li>
	<li>Finally, trying to get a good life, by that time everything is gone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Toil :</strong> Male</li>
	<li><strong>Spin :</strong> Female</li>
	<li>Solomon had wealth, glory but not health</li>
</ul>
<strong>Real Life</strong>

Eg: <strong>Birds</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Immediate Life</li>
	<li>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness</li>
	<li>Birds, thanks giving. Singing.</li>
</ul>
Eg: <strong>Lilies</strong>
<ul>
	<li>No Stress</li>
	<li>We have health through Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>Wealth and Glory shall be added unto us</li>
</ul>
Eg: <strong>Grass</strong>
<ul>
	<li>More importance even just for a day, that it should be clothed</li>
	<li>How much more, we who live eternally will be clothed (healthy)</li>
</ul>
To:
<ul>
	<li>Its for the people, "O you of little faith"</li>
</ul>
<strong>Luke 12:30-32</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

30 For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you need these things. 31 But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.

32 “Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to <strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">give you</span></strong> the kingdom.
<h2>How to receive ALL these things?</h2>
<strong>Romans 14:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>Peace is the absence of worry</li>
	<li>Joy is what God wants on his carefree children</li>
</ul>

<strong>Proverbs 17:22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22 A <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>merry heart</strong> </span>does good, like <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>medicine</strong></span>,
But a broken spirit dries the bones.

<strong>1 Peter 5:7-8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 casting all your <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>care</strong> </span>upon Him, for He cares for you.

8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.

13 And I have also given you what you have not asked: both <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>riches and honor</strong></span>, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days.

14 So if you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as your father David walked, then I will <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>lengthen your days</strong></span>.”

<h2><strong>Other Verses</strong></h2>
<strong>2 Corinthians 9:6-11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<strong> The Cheerful Giver</strong>

6 But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. 8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work. 9 As it is written:

“He has dispersed abroad,
He has given to the poor;
His righteousness endures forever.”

10 Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness, 11 while you are enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes thanksgiving through us to God.
