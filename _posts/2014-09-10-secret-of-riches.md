<strong>Proverbs 11:24-26</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 There is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>one who scatters, yet increases more</strong></span>;
And there is one who withholds more than is right,
But it leads to poverty.
25 The <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>generous soul</strong></span> will be made rich,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>he who waters</strong></span> will also be watered himself.
26 The people will curse him who withholds grain,
But blessing will be on the head of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>him who sells it</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 10:4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 He who has a slack hand becomes poor,
But the<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> hand of the diligent</strong></span> makes rich.

<strong>Proverbs 10:22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22Â The <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>blessing of the Lord</strong></span> makes one rich,
And He adds no sorrow with it.
This is Wisdom
