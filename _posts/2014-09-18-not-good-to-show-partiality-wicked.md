<strong>Proverbs 18:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>It is not good to show partiality to the wicked</strong></span>,
Or to overthrow the righteous in judgment.

Proverbs 24:23-25
New King James Version (NKJV)

23 These things also belong to the wise:

<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>It is not good to show partiality in judgment</strong></span>.
24 He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”
Him the people will curse;
Nations will abhor him.
25 But those who rebuke the wicked will have delight,
And a good blessing will come upon them.
