<h2 class="line"><strong>Young's Literal Translation's Preface </strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The Hebrew Language has no Future Tense</strong></h3>
..
<ol>
 	<li>That the Hebrews were in the habit of using the past tense to express the certainty of an action taking place, even though the action might not really be performed for some time.</li>
 	<li>That the Hebrews, in referring to events which might be either past or future, were accustomed to act on the principle of transferring themselves mentally to the period and place of the events themselves, and were not content with coldly viewing them as those of a bygone or still coming time; hence the very frequent use of the present tense.</li>
</ol>
