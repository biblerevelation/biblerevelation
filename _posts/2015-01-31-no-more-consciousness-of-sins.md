<strong>Hebrews 10:1-4</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Animal Sacrifices Insufficient</strong>

10 For <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things</strong></span>, can never with these same sacrifices, which they <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>offer continually year by year</strong></span>, make those who approach <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>perfect</strong></span>. 2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>once</strong></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>purified</strong></span>, would have had <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>no more consciousness of sins</strong></span>. 3 But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. 4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.

All the offering of the Old Testament are shadows of the substance. Jesus is the substance. If the Substance is here why do we need to go for shadow?
<ul>
	<li>The burn offering</li>
	<li>The meal offering</li>
	<li>The peace offering</li>
	<li>The sin and trespass offering</li>
</ul>

<h2>Perfect not pertaining to our behaviour, Perfect in our conscience</h2>
<strong>Hebrews 9:9-10</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

9 It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>perfect in regard to the conscience</strong></span>â€” 10 concerned only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.
