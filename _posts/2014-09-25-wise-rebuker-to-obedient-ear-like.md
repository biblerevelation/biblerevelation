<strong>Proverbs 25:11-12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold
In settings of silver.
12 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold</strong></span>
Is a wise rebuker to an obedient ear.
