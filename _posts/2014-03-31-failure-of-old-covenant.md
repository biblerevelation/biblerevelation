<ul>
	<li>Wrong with the First Covenant</li>
	<li>First one Obsolete (out of use)</li>
	<li>For Disappearance</li>
	<li>To be Dispensed with altogether</li>
</ul>
That's the Reason for the the introduction of the New Covenant (That's why we have New Testament)
<h3>Hebrews 8:7-8</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

7 For if there had been nothing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>wrong with that first covenant</strong></span>, no place would have been sought for another. 8 But God found fault with the people and said:
<div>

“The days are coming, declares the Lord,
when I will make a new covenant
with the people of Israel
and with the people of Judah.
<div>
<h3>Hebrews 8:13</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

</div>
<div>

13 When God speaks of a new [covenant or agreement], He makes the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>first one obsolete (out of use)</strong></span>. And what is obsolete (out of use and annulled because of age) is ripe <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>for disappearance <i>and</i> to be dispensed with altogether</strong></span>.
