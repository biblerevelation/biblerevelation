<h2>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It is NOT the tree of death</li>
	<li>It is NOT the tree of sin</li>
</ul>
<strong>Genesis 2:16-17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it <strong>you shall surely die</strong>.”
<h3>You shall surely die</h3>
<ul>
	<li>"Surely die" in the original language means dying you shall die , which means you shall spiritually die immediately and physically die slowly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>KNEW that they were naked</h3>
<strong>Genesis 3:7-11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-63" class="text Gen-3-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>they <i>were</i> naked</strong></span>; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-64" class="text Gen-3-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>And they heard the sound of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God among the trees of the garden.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-65" class="text Gen-3-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God called to Adam and said to him, “Where <i>are</i> you?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-66" class="text Gen-3-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>So he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>I was afraid because I was naked</strong></span>; and I hid myself.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-67" class="text Gen-3-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>And He said, “<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Who told you that you <i>were</i> naked?</strong></span> Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?”</span>
<blockquote>Their conscience which is the knowledge of discerning Good and Evil told them that they were naked</blockquote>
<h2>Sin means missing the mark</h2>
<strong>Romans 3:20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-28012" class="text Rom-3-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law <i>is</i> the <strong><span style="color: #993366;">knowledge of sin</span></strong>.</span>
<h3>knowledge of sin</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of the lack</li>
	<li>Knowledge of the nakedness</li>
	<li>Knowledge of the emptiness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conscience is the Knowledge of Discerning Good and Evil</h2>
