<strong>1 Timothy 1:11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 according to the glorious <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>gospel of the <span style="color: #008000;">blessed</span> God</strong></span> which was committed to my trust.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>blessed</strong></span> in Greek is Happy</li>
	<li>God is happy that He has a family</li>
	<li>God doesn't want servants</li>
	<li>God want sons</li>
	<li>We serve Him because we are His sons</li>
	<li>We have vested interests in theÂ family business</li>
	<li>We don't serve as slaves</li>
	<li>We serve as sons</li>
	<li>Not with a spirit of slavish fear</li>
	<li>Not the Spirit of the older brother</li>
	<li>But the Spirit of sonship</li>
</ul>
