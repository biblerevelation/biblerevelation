Let him refrain his tongue from evil,
And his lips from speaking deceit.

<strong>Psalm 34:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 Who is the man who desires life,
And loves <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;">many </span>days</strong></span>, that he may see <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>good</strong></span>?

<strong>Proverbs 3:7-8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 Do not be wise in your own eyes;
Fear the Lord and <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>depart from evil</strong></span>.

And <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>strength to your bones</strong></span>.

<strong>Isaiah 61:1-2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

1 “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me,
Because the Lord has anointed Me
To preach good tidings to the poor;
He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives,
And the opening of the prison to those who are bound;

2 To proclaim <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the</strong> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">acceptable</span> year</strong></span> of the Lord,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the day</strong></span> of vengeance of our God;
To comfort all who mourn,

<strong>Luke 4:17-21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:

18 “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,
Because He has anointed Me
To preach the gospel to the poor;
He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives
And recovery of sight to the blind,
To set at liberty those who are oppressed;
19 To proclaim <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the <span style="color: #0000ff;">acceptable</span> year</strong></span> of the Lord.”
20 Then He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him. 21 And He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”
