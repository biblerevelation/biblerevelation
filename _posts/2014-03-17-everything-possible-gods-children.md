<h3>Matthew 17:20</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>faith as a grain of mustard seed</strong></span>, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>nothing shall be impossible unto you</strong></span>.</blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.0909090909;">Philippians 4:13</span>
<div>

King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>13 I can do <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>all things</strong> </span>through Christ which strengtheneth me.</blockquote>
- Paul

<h2>Stumbling Block:</h2>
Faith as a grain of mustard seed
<h2>Overcoming Stumbling Block (Thoughts):</h2>
<ul>
	<li>What is "Faith as a grain of mustard seed" ?</li>
	<li>Ye shall <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>know</strong> </span>the Truth and the Truth shall set you FREE (Remove Stumbling Block).</li>
	<li>What's the Truth that Paul <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>know</strong> </span>on Philippians 4:13</li>
	<li>Man can't have 100% Faith without Jesus.</li>
	<li>Paul didn't have 100% Faith, but he found the meaning of "Faith like a mustard seed", that't why he said "I can do <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALL</strong> </span>things through Christ  which strengtheneth me"<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></li>
	<li>ALL literally means ALL!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Do you have "Faith as a grain of mustard seed"?</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Please move a mountain!</strong></span></li>
	<li>People interpret mountain as "problems in life", but it also <strong>includes</strong> "Physical mountain" as it says "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOTHING </strong></span>shall be impossible to you"</li>
	<li>Literally NOTHING means NOTHING!</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is "Faith as a grain of mustard seed" ?</h2>

This says that,  Every man has the measure of faith. Does that ring any bell?
