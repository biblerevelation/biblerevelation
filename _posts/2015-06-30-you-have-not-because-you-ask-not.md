<strong>James 4:2-3</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-30340" class="text Jas-4-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">you do not have because you do not ask</span></strong>. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-30341" class="text Jas-4-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend <i>it</i> on your pleasures.</span>
