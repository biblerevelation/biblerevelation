<h2><strong>Romans 10:1-3</strong></h2>
<strong>English Standard Version (ESV)</strong>

10 Brothers[a], my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. 2 For I bear them witness that they have a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>zeal for God, but not according to knowledge</strong></span>. 3 For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
