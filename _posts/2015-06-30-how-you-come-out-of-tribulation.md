<h2>About Tribulation</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Coming out of Tribulation</h2>
<strong>Psalm 66:12</strong>

<strong>King James Version (KJV)</strong>

<sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>out</strong> </span>into a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>wealthy place</strong></span>.
<strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB)</strong>
<div class="poetry top-1">
<p class="line"><span id="en-NASB-14886" class="text Ps-66-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>You made men ride over our heads;</span>
<span class="text Ps-66-12">We went through fire and through water,</span>
<span class="text Ps-66-12">Yet You brought us <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>out</strong> </span>into <i>a place of</i> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>abundance</strong></span>.</span></p>

<h3 class="line">Abundance in Hebrew</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Revayah : More than enough</li>
	<li>Reva : Intoxication</li>
</ul>
<h2>Only other time Revayah is used</h2>
<strong>Psalm 23:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<div class="poetry top-1">
<p class="line"><span id="en-NKJV-14241" class="text Ps-23-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;</span>
<span class="text Ps-23-5">You anoint my head with oil;</span>
<span class="text Ps-23-5">My cup <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>runs over</strong></span>.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="line">During the time of Holy Communion</li>
	<li class="line">Take Holy Communion in front of your enemy</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="line">Runs over in Hebrew</h3>
<ul>
	<li class="line">Revayah : More than enough</li>
	<li class="line">Reva : Intoxication</li>
</ul>
<h2>Peter was Self Confident (Example)</h2>
<strong>Luke 22:31-34</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text Luke-22-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>And the Lord said, <span class="woj">“Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift <i>you</i> as wheat.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-25897" class="text Luke-22-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup><span class="woj">But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to <i>Me,</i> strengthen your brethren.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-25898" class="text Luke-22-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>But he said to Him, “<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death</span>.</span></strong>”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-25899" class="text Luke-22-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>Then He said, <span class="woj">“I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.”</span></span>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus prayed for Peter that faith should not fail ( NOT Peter should not fail ) : some time God might allow you through testings.</li>
	<li>Jesus prophesied that Peter will return : "when you have returned"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Before devil attacks he has to think twice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Because if you respond in faith</li>
	<li>He has to give up and you have the spoils of war</li>
	<li>You will have much more ( Healing, Health , provision )</li>
	<li>You will have abundance</li>
	<li>You will have wealthy place</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tribulation to Hope</h2>

<span id="en-NKJV-28051" class="text Rom-5-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>And not only <i>that,</i> but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; </span><span id="en-NKJV-28052" class="text Rom-5-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and perseverance, character; and character, hope.</span><span id="en-NKJV-28053" class="text Rom-5-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</span>
