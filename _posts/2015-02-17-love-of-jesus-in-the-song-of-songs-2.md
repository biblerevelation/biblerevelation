Where you feed your flock,
Where you make it rest at noon.

By the flocks of your companions?

Follow in the footsteps of the flock,
And feed your little goats
Beside the shepherds’ tents.

	<li class="line">White means dazzling in greek</li>
	<li class="line">Chief in greek</li>
	<li class="line">Jesus is the Hero of Heroes, chief among 10,000</li>
	<li class="line">David " you are worth 10 thousand of us "</li>
	<li class="line">10,000 * 10,000 is innumerable  singing worthy is the Lamp in Revelation</li>
	<li class="line">ruddy , = red</li>
	<li class="line">Bible says David has rossy cheeks</li>
	<li class="line">Purity and passion ( white and ruddy )</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="line">Story of Gideon</h2>
Week, Small and Significant
<ul>
	<li class="line">God chose the humble. Least tribe : manase. Least of his fathers family.</li>
	<li class="line">He was nervous</li>
	<li class="line">As per Gods instruction, Gideon and some people with him went and saw their enemies. Enemies were like the sand on the sea shore that no one could number</li>
	<li class="line">Gideon heard a Guard of Medianites talking to another guard about a dream the guard saw. The Guard saw a barley bread came down from the hill and smashed all the tents</li>
	<li class="line">Jesus is the Bread of Life, which will destroy all enemies.</li>
	<li class="line">Gideon prepared 32,000 people. But God said no. Finally only 300 people where chosen using a test where only these 300 people drank water taking on their hand and like a dog in a well call harote ( harote in hebrew called trembling )
<ul>
	<li class="line">Thing to learn from this is, it could be any blessing, but keep that in control in your hands. Don't let the blessing control you</li>
	<li class="line">"All things are lawful for me, but i will not be brought under the power of any" - Apostle Paul</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li class="line">To confirm his calling, Gideon asked God to wet the Flees and make other remains around it to be dry, it happened as it is</li>
	<li class="line">Again, Gideon asked God to make dry the Flees and make other remains wet. It happened as it was asked. This confirms Gideon's calling.</li>
	<li class="line">Fless is the wool of the Lamp. The Lamp of God.</li>
	<li class="line">Jesus is that Flees. When Jesus came down from heaven He was full of grace. Heavens dew was upon Him. Everywhere He goes power goes out of Him, if they were wrong they were set right, if they were blind they saw, if they in leprosy they got cleansed, majestic exds  of Lebanon</li>
	<li class="line">Jesus gave up Himself to be made dry on the cross that we could get heavens dew ( Grace ) .</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Gideon Defeated his enemy</h3>
<ul>
	<li>300 men went to the battle</li>
	<li>A light inside the lamp, and a ramps Horn. No Weapon</li>
	<li>300 men blew the trumpet
<ul>
	<li>By preaching Gods word, By preaching the death of Jesus the Lamp, our earthen vessel is broken, you are humbled and then the light can shine and it brought victory to all the people of God.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Moses, Elijah and Jesus not on the same ground</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Moses Failed, Elijah Failed, Jesus never fails</li>
	<li>God told "Here Him", Not Them, in the mount of transfiguration.</li>
	<li>The women near the well, started with saying : Jew --&gt; Sir --&gt; Prophet --&gt; Messiah</li>
</ul>
<h3>Faith</h3>
Its not about you have little faith, you have great faith.
<ul>
	<li>Faith is the response to the revelation of Jesus</li>
	<li>The more of Jesus you see the more faith you have</li>
	<li>The moment you see faith, it takes wings and fly away</li>
	<li>When you put eye on Jesus faith is there to stay</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impeccability of Christ</h3>
<h4>Wrong belief</h4>
<ul>
	<li>There are those who teach that Jesus could have sin, He was tempted on all points as we are, so He could sin if He wanted to</li>
	<li>But the only difference between Jesus and us is that we said yes to Temptation, but Jesus said no.</li>
	<li>They agree that Jesus never sinned, but He was tempted.</li>
</ul>
Wrong Belief example: He was tempted to punch people in the face
<h4>Correct Belief</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Impeccability of Christ means Jesus cannot sin.</li>
	<li>Even when He was on earth, He cannot sin.</li>
	<li>He never has the inward urge to be tempted as we are</li>
	<li>we have a fallen body that we got from Adam, but He didn't</li>
	<li>Where Adam was innocent even before he fall, but the Lord was holy ( The Last Adam )</li>
	<li>He was always Deity that brought on Humanity</li>
	<li>Our Heart was so small to handle the big subject we are learning.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Hebrews 4:15</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>tempted</strong></span> as we are, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>yet without sin</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>tempted</strong></span> : temptation to sin or tested in life or trials in life</li>
	<li>W E Wines expository meaning : Not referring to "He never said yes to temptation"
<ul>
	<li>That means He is tested in all points, but not in the area of sin.
<ul>
	<li>sin exempted</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Never temptation to sin</li>
	<li>He cannot be tempted to sin</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Tested on all points</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus was rejected</li>
	<li>Jesus suffered grief</li>
	<li>Jesus was tired</li>
	<li>Jesus was thirsty</li>
	<li>Jesus was hungry</li>
	<li>Jesus experienced the whole emotions of being rejected</li>
	<li>Kiss of betrayal on His cheeks</li>
	<li>He came to His own (Jews) , His own received Him not.</li>
	<li>He felt the pains of rejection</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>But not pertaining to sin</blockquote>
<h2 class="line">White</h2>
<ul>
	<li class="line">That is the white ( e.g.: Impeccability of Christ )</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="line">Ruddy</h2>
<ul>
	<li class="line">From the word Adom</li>
	<li class="line">Hebrew for Blood is Dum/Dummim(Plural). Blood red.</li>
	<li class="line">Adam = = Red man</li>
	<li class="line">E dom = = Red</li>
</ul>
<p class="line">White and Ruddy : Fully God and Fully man</p>

<h2 class="line">The Finest Gold</h2>
<p class="line"><span id="en-NKJV-17610" class="text Song-5-11"><span class="versenum">11 </span>His head <i>is like</i> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the finest gold</strong></span>;</span>
<span class="text Song-5-11">His locks <i>are</i> wavy,</span>
<span class="text Song-5-11"><i>And</i> black as a raven.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="line">Jesus never grew old. He can never grow old. The time has no effect of Him. He is young always. As He is so you are you in this world</li>
	<li class="line">Gold speaks of supremacy or Deity</li>
</ul>
Fine Gold Vs the Finest Gold
<h2 class="line">Story of Daniel</h2>
<ul>
	<li class="line">King Nebuchadnezzar was searching for someone to tell him what he saw in this dream and its interpretation</li>
	<li class="line">Daniel and teen age friends gathered together and prayer. First corporate prayer. And then Daniel knew the dream and its interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="line">Verses</h3>
<strong>Daniel 2:25-48</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

25 Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, “I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.”

26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”

27 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king. 28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, were these: 29 As for you, O king, thoughts came to your mind while on your bed, about what would come to pass after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be. 30 But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for our sakes who make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.

31 “You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor was excellent, stood before you; and its form was awesome. 32 This image’s head was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. 34 You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.

36 “This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. 37 You, O king, are a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; 38 and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all—you are this head of gold. 39 But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. 40 And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, that kingdom will break in pieces and crush all the others. 41 Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. 42 And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. 43 As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. 44 And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. 45 Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold—the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.”
<h3><strong>Daniel and His Friends Promoted</strong></h3>
46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him. 47 The king answered Daniel, and said, “Truly your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.” 48 Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon.
<ul>
	<li>Jesus head is like the Finest Gold</li>
	<li>He is the Great High Priest.</li>
	<li>Never in the history of Israel, the High Priest called Great High Priest</li>
	<li>Similarly He was also called Great Sheppard</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar dream</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Head : Gold : <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Babylonian Empire</strong></span> 646 BC ( Iraq )</li>
	<li>Chest : Silver : <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Medo-Persian Empire</strong></span> ( Iran )</li>
	<li>Bronze : <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Greek Empire</strong></span> ( Later in Chapter 7 talks about Alexander the great )</li>
	<li>Legs : Iron : <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Roman Empire</strong></span> ( God send His Son ) , cut in to west and east, Two legs</li>
	<li>Partly Iron , Partly Clay : Iron ----&gt; absolute rule, like a dictator. Clay is --&gt; Democracy : <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Revive Roman Empire</strong></span> : Present day</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Gentile Rule, non Jewish rule</li>
	<li>You saw a rock cut without human hands, smashing the legs, whole thing breaking in to pieces</li>
	<li>Who is that rock ? Lord Jesus</li>
	<li>Rock will become a great mountain, that is our Rock Jesus and His kingdom when He comes to Rule</li>
</ul>
<h3>Man : Deteriorating</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Gold</li>
	<li>Silver</li>
	<li>Bronze</li>
	<li>Iron</li>
	<li>Partly Iron and Partly Clay</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jesus : No Deteriorating</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Heads : Gold</li>
	<li>Hands : Rods of Gold</li>
	<li>Legs : pillars of Fine Gold</li>
</ul>
Gold means supreme power.
<blockquote>Seek for nothing, be humble</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Everything you pin in man's hand deteriorate</li>
	<li>Everything you put in Jesus hand it never deteriorates</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Prophet Samuel to Saul : "When God chose you, where you not little in your own sight"</li>
	<li>e.g.: When starting 10% Tithe could be little, so its easy to give , but when Salary increases 10% Tithe might look big and people might hesitate to give.</li>
	<li>There might be small tests ( Tests are not diseases )</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Stay low, that's where the water goes</li>
</ul>
<h2>We may seek Him</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Shulamite tells about the greatness of Solomon
<ul>
	<li>She was testifying about Him</li>
	<li>That stirred the hears of The Daughters of Jerusalem</li>
	<li>It struck a passion in them for Him</li>
	<li>She wasn't even talking to Jesus</li>
	<li>She ignited her own fire</li>
	<li>She struck fire on their hearts who were listening</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Result : The Daughters of Jerusalem also now wants to seek Solomon</li>
	<li>Result : Now She knows where Solomon is
<ul>
	<li>Just by talking about Him, She knows where He is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Song of Solomon 6:1-3</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Daughters of Jerusalem</strong>

6 Where has your beloved gone,
O fairest among women?
Where has your beloved turned aside,
That <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>we may seek him</strong></span> with you?

<strong>The Shulamite</strong>

2 <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>My beloved has gone to his garden</strong></span>,
To the beds of spices,
To <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>feed his flock</strong></span> in the gardens,
And to gather lilies.
3 <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>I am my beloved’s,</strong></span>
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>And my beloved is mine</strong></span>.
He feeds his flock among the lilies.
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">feed his flock :</span> </strong>Jesus always feeding His flock</li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #333399;">My beloved has gone to his garden</span> : </strong>She found where Her beloved is</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Before: My Beloved is mine --&gt; Very Possessive</li>
	<li>After : Song of Songs 6 : 3a <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>I am my beloved’s, </strong></span><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>And my beloved is mine</strong></span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Lilies are white, pure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Experience with Jesus Vs Other Peoples argument</h3>
<blockquote>No matter how argumentative your friends are, the one with the experience will never be at the mercy of the one with the argument</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>No one can argue with your experience.</li>
	<li>To know where Jesus is, To get back His presence, <strong>To ignite fire on others</strong> : Talk about Him</li>
</ul>
<h2>Son of Man</h2>
<h3><strong>First time Son of Man</strong></h3>
<strong>Matthew 8:20</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”

Picture of Jesus labouring all the time, Cleaning, Cleansing, Healing, Opening eyes, Blessing, Multiplying, Re-assuring, Restoring, Lifting, Encouraging, Giving, Blessing. Multitude followed Him wherever  He went. He loves them.
<ul>
	<li>Once upon a time man put crown of thorns on His head</li>
	<li>man <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>hit</strong> </span>( continuously : imperfect tense )  his head with reed ( things we use to make flute ) when Jesus was wearing thorns , blood was over his face ( <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ruddy</strong></span> )</li>
	<li>beloved is white and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ruddy</strong></span>.</li>
	<li>He could have been white alone, but He loved us so much that He came down and hence ruddy, to save us</li>
	<li>Jesus was accused saying "He saved others but He cannot save Himself ",
<ul>
	<li>Yes. Because to save others He cannot save Himself</li>
	<li>He has to pay</li>
	<li>Head, which bore the crown of thorns and blood everywhere.</li>
	<li>So it became ruddy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Last time Son of Man</h3>
<strong>Revelation 14:14</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Reaping the Earth’s Harvest</strong>

14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>His head a golden crown</strong></span>, and in His hand a sharp sickle.

<strong>Revelation 19:12</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>His head were many crowns</strong></span>. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself.
<ul>
	<li>Crowns
<ul>
	<li>Crown of Ministerial Glory</li>
	<li>Crown of Moral Glory</li>
	<li>Crown of Official Glory</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Where Jesus rules, no sickness can rule, no demon can rule. We are waiting for that</li>
	<li>Before He was wearing thorns in His head and now His head with Crowns</li>
</ul>
