<h2>Jesus the Good Shepherd</h2>
<strong>John 10:7-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text John-10-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Then Jesus said to them again, <span class="woj">“Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26490" class="text John-10-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup><span class="woj">All who <i>ever</i> came before Me</span><span class="woj"> are <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>thieves</strong> </span>and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>robbers</strong></span>, but the sheep did not hear them.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26491" class="text John-10-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup><span class="woj">I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26492" class="text John-10-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup><span class="woj">The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have <i>it</i> more abundantly.</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26493" class="text John-10-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup><span class="woj">“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.</span></span><span id="en-NKJV-26494" class="text John-10-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup><span class="woj">But a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>hireling</strong></span>, <i>he who is</i> not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>wolf</strong> </span>coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26495" class="text John-10-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup><span class="woj">The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26496" class="text John-10-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup><span class="woj">I am the good shepherd; and I know My <i>sheep,</i> and am known by My own.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26497" class="text John-10-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup><span class="woj">As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26498" class="text John-10-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup><span class="woj">And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock <i>and</i> one shepherd.</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26499" class="text John-10-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup><span class="woj">“Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26500" class="text John-10-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup><span class="woj">No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father.”</span></span>
