<h2>Beholding Jesus Transforms us</h2>
<strong>2 Corinthians 3:18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

18 But we all, with unveiled face, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>beholding</strong></span> as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>transformed into the same image</strong></span> from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.
<h2>When Peter Behold (seeing) Jesus</h2>
<h3>Being Supernatural</h3>
<blockquote>As long as Peter Behold Jesus, Peter was walking in the water</blockquote>
<strong>Matthew 14:22-33</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Jesus Walks on the Sea</strong>

<span class="text Matt-14-22"><span class="versenum">22 </span>Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. </span><span id="en-NKJV-23621" class="text Matt-14-23"><span class="versenum">23 </span>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there. </span><span id="en-NKJV-23622" class="text Matt-14-24"><span class="versenum">24 </span>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23623" class="text Matt-14-25"><span class="versenum">25 </span>Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. </span><span id="en-NKJV-23624" class="text Matt-14-26"><span class="versenum">26 </span>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out for fear.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23625" class="text Matt-14-27"><span class="versenum">27 </span>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="woj">“Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23626" class="text Matt-14-28"><span class="versenum">28 </span>And Peter answered Him and said, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23627" class="text Matt-14-29"><span class="versenum">29 </span>So He said, <span class="woj">“Come.”</span> And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. </span><span id="en-NKJV-23628" class="text Matt-14-30"><span class="versenum">30 </span>But <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>when he saw that the wind</strong></span> <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23629" class="text Matt-14-31"><span class="versenum">31 </span>And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, <span class="woj">“O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-23630" class="text Matt-14-32"><span class="versenum">32 </span>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23631" class="text Matt-14-33"><span class="versenum">33 </span>Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God.”</span>
