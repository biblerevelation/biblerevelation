<strong>Matthew 16:25</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

25 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>loses his life for My sake</strong></span> will <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>find it</strong></span>.
<h2>Loses his life for "My sake"</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Lose his time in church serving Jesus</li>
	<li>Lose his money for doing something for Jesus</li>
</ul>
