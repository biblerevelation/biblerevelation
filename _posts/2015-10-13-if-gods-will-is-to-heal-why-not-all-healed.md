First answer this question
<h2>If Gods Will is that all to be Saved, Why not all Saved?</h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">2 Peter 3:9
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-30532" class="text 2Pet-3-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>The Lord is not slack concerning <i>His</i> promise, as some count slackness, but is long suffering toward us, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>not willing that any should perish</strong></span> but that <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>all</strong> </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>should come to repentance</strong></span>.</span>
