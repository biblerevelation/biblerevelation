Proverbs 8:8-9
New King James Version (NKJV)
<blockquote>8 All the words of my mouth are with righteousness;
Nothing crooked or perverse is in them.
9 They are <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>all plain</strong></span> to <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">him who understands</span></strong>,
And right to those who find knowledge.</blockquote>
