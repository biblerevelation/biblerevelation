<strong>John 6:48-54</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

48 I am the bread of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>life</strong></span>.
49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
50 This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.
51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>life</strong></span>(<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>zovi</strong></span>) of the world.”

52 The Jews therefore quarreled among themselves, saying, “How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?”

53 Then Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>eat( estheo - eat )</strong></span> the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you.
54 Whoever <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">eats (trogo - chews)</span></strong> My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
<h2>eat</h2>
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>estheo ( Greek )</strong></span>

- to eat, take food

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>trogo ( Greek )</strong></span>

- to chew, cruch ( through the idea of a crunching sound - Theyar )
<h2> Comments 2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I have come that you could eat me and receive the very life of God himself</li>
	<li>Death is an enemy for God</li>
	<li>Sin bring forth death</li>
	<li>God hates death</li>
	<li>The last enemy that will be put under our feat is death</li>
	<li>Spiritual death has been conquered : The moment you receive Jesus Christ, we got translated from death unto life</li>
	<li>Physical has been conquered by Christ when he rose from the dead</li>
	<li>But we are waiting for its manifestation</li>
	<li>As we draw closer to the day, there is a generation in bible who are alive and remain alive.</li>
</ul>
<strong>1 Corinthians 11:29-30</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

29 For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>manner</strong></span> eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
30 For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep.
