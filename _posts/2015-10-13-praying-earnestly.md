<strong>James 5:17-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 Elijah was <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>a man with a nature like ours</strong></span>, and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>he prayed earnestly</strong></span> that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.
