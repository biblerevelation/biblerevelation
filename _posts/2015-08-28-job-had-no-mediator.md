<h2>Job</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Job was <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>not at rest</strong></span></li>
	<li>Resulted in getting what he feared</li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Job had no one to rest Him</strong></span></li>
	<li><strong>Job had no mediator</strong></li>
	<li>But we have Jesus to rest us</li>
</ul>
<h2>No Mediator</h2>
<strong>Job 9:33</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<div class="poetry">
<p class="line"><span id="en-NKJV-13085" class="text Job-9-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Nor is there any mediator between us</strong></span>,</span>
<span class="text Job-9-33"><i>Who</i> may lay his hand on us both.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="line">Jesus was not crucified then, during the time of Job</li>
	<li class="line">No Mediator was there between Job and God</li>
	<li class="line">We believers, have a Mediator who is called Jesus</li>
	<li class="line">So we don't need to carry all the burden which Job did</li>
