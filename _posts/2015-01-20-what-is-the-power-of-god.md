<strong>Romans 1:16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Just Live by Faith</strong>

16 For I am not ashamed of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the gospel of Christ</strong></span>, for it is <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the power of God</strong></span> to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the power</strong></span> in Greek : Dunamis, derived from the word Dunamai, where dynamite comes from.</li>
