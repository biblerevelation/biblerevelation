<strong>Hebrews 4:11</strong>

11 Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience.
<h2>First Peace, then Healing</h2>
<strong>Isaiah 53:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 But He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,
And by His stripes we are healed.

	<li>by His stripes we are healed</li>
</ol>

<strong>Hebrews 4:1-4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Promise of Rest</strong>

4 Therefore, since a promise remains of entering <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>His rest, let us fear</strong></span> lest any of you seem to have come short of it.

2 For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>not being mixed with faith</strong></span> in those who <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>heard</strong> </span>it.
<blockquote class="alignright">
<p style="text-align: right;">We who have believed do enter that rest</p>
</blockquote>
3 For <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">we who have believed</span> do enter that rest</strong></span>, as He has said:

“So I swore in My wrath,
‘They shall not enter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">My rest</span>,’”
<blockquote class="alignright">"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">My rest</span>: God calls the land us My rest". For you and I, the substance of the land is rest</blockquote>
although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

4 For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”;
<h2>Only Labour in Bible</h2>
<strong>Hebrews 4:9-11</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ceased from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> own works</strong></span>, as God did from his.
11 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest</strong></span>, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
<ul>
	<li>Rest means Belief</li>
	<li>No Rest means Unbelief</li>
	<li>Man should cease from <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>his</strong></span> own work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Importance of Rest</h2>

<strong>Genesis 2:2-3</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

2 And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.

3 Then God blessed the <strong>seventh</strong> day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.

	<li>Promise : Bersheva : &gt; Ber --&gt; Well, Sheva --&gt; Seven and also Sheva means Promise , sabbath comes from Sheva</li>
	<li>Well of promise</li>
	<li>You rest because God's work is perfect</li>
</ul>

127 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Unless the Lord builds the house,</strong></span>

To sit up late,
To eat the bread of sorrows;
For so He gives His beloved sleep.
