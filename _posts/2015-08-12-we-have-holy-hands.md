<h2>All Believers in Christ</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Will have Holy Hands</li>
</ul>
<h2>1 Timothy 2:8</h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>holy hands</strong></span>, without wrath and doubting;
<h2>Holy Hands</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Hands set apart for Christ</li>
</ul>
<h2>As a result</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Whatever we touch shall prosper</li>
	<li>When we touch a diseased person, the person will be healed
<ul>
	<li>Christ in us will be passed on to the diseased person. Where there is Christ, there will be no disease.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
