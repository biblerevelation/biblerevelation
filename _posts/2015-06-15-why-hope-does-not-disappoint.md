<strong>Romans 5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

Faith Triumphs in Trouble
5 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>hope of the glory of God</strong></span>.

3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance;

4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope.

5 Now <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit</strong></span> who was given to us.
