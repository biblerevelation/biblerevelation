<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">1 Samuel 6:19
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-7351" class="text 1Sam-6-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Then He struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>looked into the ark</strong></span> of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>He struck fifty thousand and seventy men</strong></span> of the people, and the people lamented because the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> had struck the people with a great slaughter.</span>
<ul>
	<li>To Look into the ark, you need to move the mercy seat.</li>
	<li>Ark has ten commandments inside</li>
</ul>
When we bring back the law, removing the mercy seat ( Grace/Undeserved Favor/Gift ), people die.
