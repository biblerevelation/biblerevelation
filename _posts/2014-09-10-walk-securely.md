<strong>Proverbs 10:9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

9 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who walks with integrity walks securely</strong></span>,
But he who perverts his ways will become known.

<strong>Proverbs 11:3</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 The <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>integrity</strong> </span>of the upright will guide them,
But the perversity of the unfaithful will destroy them.
