<h3>Hebrews 8:6</h3>
New Living Translation (NLT)

</div>
<div>

6Â But now <strong>Jesus, our High Priest</strong>, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises.

Jesus is our High Priest.
