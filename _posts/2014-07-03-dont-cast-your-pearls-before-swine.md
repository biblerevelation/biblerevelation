<h1 class="passage-display" style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;"><span class="passage-display-bcv">Matthew 7:6</span></h1>
New King James Version (NKJV)
<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-23323" class="text Matt-7-6"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">6 </span><span class="woj">“Do not give what is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>holy</strong></span> to the dogs; <strong>nor cast your <span style="color: #0000ff;">pearls</span> before swine</strong>, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pigs/Swine don't <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appreciate the beauty/value</span> of the pearl if its found under its feet </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Dogs don't care if the meat/food is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> Altar or from garbage</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Pigs/Swine :</strong> people who don't value <strong>your pearl</strong>

<strong>Dogs :</strong> people who don't value <strong>you/God's </strong><b>children</b>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Our life, time, energy, opportunities and abilities are God's <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>pearls</strong></span>. They're His!</li>
	<li>whatever we make/create are <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>holy</strong></span>, because we are separated unto God. We are God's children.</li>
	<li>Don't cast it among people who don't value it or among people who don't care about it</li>
	<li>Make sure you discern through the wisdom of Christ, on to whom you are casting it to.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> Even if you don't cast on to the right people, again you are wasting those pearls.
