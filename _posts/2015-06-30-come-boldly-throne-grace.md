<strong>Hebrews 4:14-16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

Our Compassionate High Priest

14 Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
15 For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.
16 Let us therefore <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>come boldly to the throne of grace</strong></span>, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
