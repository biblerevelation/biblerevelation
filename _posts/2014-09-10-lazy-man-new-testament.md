<strong>2 Thessalonians 3:6-15</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Warning Against Idleness</strong>

6 But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us.

7 For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you;

8 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>nor did we eat anyone’s bread free of charge</strong></span>, but <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>worked with labor and toil night and day</strong></span>, that we might not be a burden to any of you,

9 not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us.

10 For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat</span></strong>.

11 For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies.

12 Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.

13 But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good.

14 And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.

15 Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

<strong>1 Thessalonians 5:12-15</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>labor</strong> </span>among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 13 and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.

14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all.

15 See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.

<strong>1 Timothy 5:13</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.

<strong>Titus 1:12</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>lazy gluttons</strong></span>.”

<strong>Titus 3:14</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful.

<strong>Hebrews 6:12</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 that you <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>do not become sluggish</strong></span>, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

<strong>Matthew 20:3</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 And he went out about the third hour and saw others <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>standing idle</strong></span> in the marketplace,

<strong>Matthew 25:24-30</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 “Then he who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is yours.’

26 “But his lord answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>lazy servant</strong></span>, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed. 27 So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. 28 Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents.

29 ‘For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
