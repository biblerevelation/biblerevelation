<h3>Hebrews 12:2</h3>
<div>

New King James Version (NKJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>2 looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of <i>our</i> faith, who for the joy that was set before Him <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>endured</strong><strong> the cross</strong></span>, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus Christ #endured the cross, for OUR Joy.</li>
	<li>Jesus Christ didn't enjoy the cross.</li>
	<li>He "endured" the pain, as our Happiness <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>(</strong></span> <strong>permanent happiness :</strong> permanent free from deceases, permanent free from sickness, permanent free from pain, permanent free from crying and more <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>)</strong> </span>was set before Him if he would endure the pain.
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>His Joy</strong></span> is to give us permanent happiness, so He endured the pain.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>His highest Priority</strong></span> is to give us permanent happiness, so He endured the pain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Matthew 13:44-46</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>44 The kingdom of heaven is like something precious buried in a field, which a man found and hid again; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field.

45 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a dealer in search of fine <i>and</i> precious pearls,

46 Who, on finding a single pearl of great price, went and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sold all he had</strong></span> and bought it.</blockquote>
<h2>Sold all he had</h2>
Sold all he had = All Jesus had was Himself, so he gave Himself. He died for you and me on the cross, to redeem us from sin and to give us permanent happiness (JOY)
