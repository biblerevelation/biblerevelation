<strong>Proverbs 23:19-21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

19 Hear, my son, and be wise;
And guide your heart in the way.
20 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not mix with winebibbers,</strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> Or with gluttonous</strong></span> eaters of meat;
21 For the drunkard and the glutton will come to <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>poverty</strong></span>,
And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.
