<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="color: #000080;">HEARING</span> Steadily bring forth Fruit with Patience</span></h2>
Three types about Hearing:
<ol>
	<li>Heard : Past Tense</li>
	<li>Hear</li>
	<li>Hearing : Present Continuous Tense</li>
</ol>
<h2>Revelation:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Its NOT about DOING</li>
	<li>Its about HEARING first and continuous HEARING.</li>
	<li>Hearing Bring forth Fruit, not by Trying to do (not by Trying to be good / not by trying to do good things).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Luke 8:12-15</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

<div>

12 Those along the traveled road are the people who have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>heard</strong></span>; then the devil comes and carries away the message out of their hearts, that they may not believe ([a]acknowledge Me as their Savior and devote themselves to Me) and be saved [here and hereafter].

13 And those upon the rock [are the people] who, when they <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>hear</strong> </span>[the Word], receive <i>and </i>welcome it with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a while, and in time of trial<i>and</i> temptation fall away (withdraw and stand aloof).

14 And as for what fell among the thorns, these are [the people] who <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>hear</strong></span>, but as they go on their way they are choked <i>and</i> suffocated with the anxieties <i>and</i> cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not ripen (come to maturity and perfection).

15 But as for that [seed] in the good soil, these are [the people] who, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000080;"><strong>hearing</strong> </span>the Word, hold it fast in a just ([b]noble, virtuous) and worthy heart, and steadily bring forth fruit with patience.
