<strong>Proverbs 9:13-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h2>The Way of Folly</h2>
13 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>A foolish woman</strong></span> is clamorous;
She is simple, and knows nothing.
14 For she sits at the door of her house,
On a seat by the highest places of the city,
15 To call to those who pass by,
Who go straight on their way:
16 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here”;
And as for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,
17 “Stolen water is sweet,
And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”
18 But he does not know that the dead are there,
That her guests are in the depths of hell.
