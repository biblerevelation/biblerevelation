<strong>Proverbs 6:16-19</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 These six things the Lord hates,
Yes, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>seven are an abomination to Him</strong></span>:
17 A proud look,
A lying tongue,
Hands that shed innocent blood,
18 A heart that devises wicked plans,
Feet that are swift in running to evil,
19 A false witness who speaks lies,
And one who sows discord among brethren.
