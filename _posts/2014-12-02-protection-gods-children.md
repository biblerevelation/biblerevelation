<h2>Protection in the Old Testament</h2>
<h3>The Ninth Plague: Darkness</h3>
<strong>Exodus 10:21-23</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, darkness which may even be felt.” 22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days. 23 They did not see one another; nor did anyone rise from his place for three days. But <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">all</span> the <span style="color: #808000;">children of Israel</span> had <span style="color: #008000;">light</span> in their dwellings</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>ALL</strong></span></li>
	<li>This light is a <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>supernatural light</strong></span>,
<ul>
	<li>if it's a candle light, Egyptians could also have had those candle lights, because Israelites are in Egypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #808000;">children of Israel :</span></strong> We are the children of Israel now</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protection in the Future</h2>
( in the Book of Revelation )
<h3>Rapture of 144,000 Jews</h3>
<strong>Revelation 7:1-4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

The Sealed of Israel
7 After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree. 2 Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, 3 saying, “<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not harm</strong></span> the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads</span></strong>.” 4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel were sealed</strong></span>:

<strong>Revelation 14:1</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Lamb and the 144,000</strong>

14 Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>one hundred and forty-four thousand</strong></span>, having <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>His Father’s name written on their foreheads</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>After 3rd Chapter in Revelation, there is no mention of Church.</li>
	<li>After the rapture, we will be in heaving looking over the tribulation happening in the world for 7 years.</li>
	<li>Church taken to heaven before the 7 years of Tribulation</li>
	<li>After 3 and Half years of the tribulation time, 144,000 people will be taken to heaven and then the Greater Tribulation starts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jesus name on our forehead Now</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We think of Jesus when we are in the midst of any trouble.</li>
	<li>We think of Jesus</li>
	<li>No evil can harm us</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protection now</h2>
<h3>Safety of Abiding in the Presence of God</h3>
<strong>Psalm 91:1-10</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

1 He who dwells in the secret place of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the Most High</strong></span>
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I will say of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the Lord</strong></span>, “He is my refuge and my fortress;
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>My God</strong></span>, in Him I will trust.”
3 Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler
And from the perilous pestilence.
4 He shall cover you with His feathers,
And under His wings you shall take refuge;
His truth shall be your shield and <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>buckler</strong></span>.
5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>night</strong></span>,
Nor of the arrow that flies by <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>day</strong></span>,
6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>darkness</strong></span>,
Nor of the destruction that lays waste at <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>noonday</strong></span>.
7 A thousand may fall at your side,
And ten thousand at your right hand;
But it shall not come near you.
8 Only with your eyes shall you look,
And see the reward of the wicked.
9 <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Because</strong></span> you have made <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the Lord</strong></span>, who is my refuge,
Even <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the Most High</strong></span>, your dwelling place,
10 <span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>No</strong> </span>evil shall befall you,
<span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Nor</strong> </span>shall any plague come near your dwelling;
<ul>
	<li>Dwelling ==&gt; Family</li>
	<li>Perilous Pestilence ==&gt; Dangerous Disease</li>
	<li>Pestilence that walks in darkness ==&gt; Disease which we never knew about</li>
	<li>destruction that lays waste at noonday ==&gt; Eg: accidents, problems</li>
	<li>terror by night ==&gt; ghosts and spirits</li>
	<li>arrow that flies ==&gt; Missiles</li>
</ul>
