<h2>Receiving</h2>
<strong>Romans 5:17-21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)

18 Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life. 19 For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.

20 Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, 21 so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<strong>John 8:11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 She said, “No one, Lord.”

And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.”

<strong>1 Corinthians 15:34</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

34 <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Awake to righteousness, and do not sin</strong></span>; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.
<ul>
	<li>Awake to righteousness first, leads to no sinning</li>
	<li>"Neither do i condemn you, go and sin no more"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prison of sin and Prison of Righteousness</h2>
<strong>Romans 6:18-20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

18 And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. 19 I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness.

20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.

<strong>Romans 6:22-23</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22 But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

</div>
<strong>2 Corinthians 10:4-6</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 For <strong>the weapons of our warfare are not carnal</strong> but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, <strong>bringing every thought into captivity</strong> to the obedience of Christ, 6 and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.

<h2>Love of God</h2>
<strong>Isaiah 53:4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 Surely He has borne our griefs
And carried our sorrows;
Yet we esteemed Him stricken,
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Smitten by God</strong></span>, and afflicted.

<strong>Isaiah 53:10</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 Yet <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>it pleased the Lord to bruise Him</strong></span>;
He has put Him to grief.
When You make His soul an offering for sin,
He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days,
And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.

<strong>Hebrews 12:2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

2 looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>for the joy that was set before Him</strong></span> endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
<ul>
	<li>Righteousness in not dead and acts in New Testament</li>
	<li>Righteousness is a gift</li>
	<li>When Gods Love fills our hearts, Love fulfils the law, even without thinking</li>
	<li>Righteous people don't sin because the Love of the Father is in them</li>
	<li>Righteous people don't lie because they are not afraid of anyone, except God in the sense of worshipping Him</li>
	<li>Righteous people don't steal because they know God will provide for their need</li>

<strong>Isaiah 53:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 But He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,
And by His stripes we are healed.

<strong>Romans 11:29</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

29 For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.

<strong>Matthew 5:10</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

<strong>Hebrews 5:12-14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Spiritual Immaturity</strong>

12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. 13 For everyone who partakes only of milk is <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>unskilled in the word of righteousness</strong></span>, for <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>he is a babe</strong></span>. 14 But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

<strong>Romans 10:10</strong>

<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 For with the heart one believes unto <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>righteousness</strong></span>, and with the mouth confession is made unto <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>salvation</strong> </span>( sozo in greek ).

<strong>Amplified Bible (AMP)</strong>

10 For with the heart a person believes (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Christ) and so is justified (declared righteous, acceptable to God), and with the mouth he confesses (declares openly and speaks out freely his faith) and confirms [his] salvation.

<strong>New International Version (NIV)</strong>

10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.

<strong>Saved in Greek</strong>
<ul>
	<li>sozo</li>
	<li>sozo means all rounded deliverance and salvation</li>
	<li>http://biblehub.com/greek/4982.htm</li>
	<li>sozo includes healing, prosperity...</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>With our mouth we confess unto healing but with our heart we must believe that we are the Righteousness of God in Christ</blockquote>
<h3>When faith becomes effortless?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When you believe that we are the Righteousness of God in Christ , faith is effortless</li>
	<li>Establishing heart in righteousness first then comes healing</li>
	<li>Apostle Paul burden in the New Testament is trying to get people to believe that they are righteous by faith, then healing will not be a problem, prosperity will not be a problem</li>
</ul>
Matthew 6:33
New King James Version (NKJV)

33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
<h3>Kingdom of God</h3>
<strong>Romans 14:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
<blockquote>Kingdom of God is not what goes inside you, it is what comes out of you</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>First His Righteousness , then follows peace, then follows joy</li>
	<li>Our Righteousness : what we do</li>
	<li>His Righteousness : Gift</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Righteousness</h2>
<strong>Matthew 5:20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.

Fact is that we can't be righteous as God by ourselves.
<h2>Righteousness of God</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Don't try to be Righteous by our efforts/works, but Righteousness by Faith</li>
	<li>Bible says "you will be made righteousness of God", which exceed every other righteousness</li>
	<li>It's not the righteousness of Elijah</li>
	<li>It's not the righteousness of Elisha</li>
	<li>It's not the righteousness of David</li>
	<li>It's not the righteousness of Paul</li>
	<li>It's the righteousness of God</li>
	<li>Righteousness of God exceeds scribes and Pharisees</li>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Use our faith not for things</strong></span>, use our faith to believe that we are Righteous by faith, then all these things shall be added unto us ( New Testament )</li>
	<li>When things come to us, they don't really mean much to us any more. Because Jesus means everything.</li>
	<li>But we learn to use things to bless others, because we know that we are the Righteousness of God in Christ. We are secure. There is nothing to prove , no one to impress any more.</li>
</ul>
<strong>2 Corinthians 5:21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>righteousness of God in Him</strong></span>.

<strong>1 Corinthians 1:30</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>righteousness</strong> </span>and sanctification and redemption—

<strong>Romans 3:22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22 even <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ</strong></span>, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference;

Paul's own Righteousness as rubbish

<strong>Philippians 3:4-11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 though I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so: 5 circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; 6 concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.

7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>count them as rubbish</strong></span>, that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; 10 that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, 11 if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.

<strong>1 Peter 2:24</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed.
<ul>
	<li>You can be more Holy but you can't be more Righteousness. Because Righteousness is a gift.</li>
	<li>The more you are established in Righteousness you get holier.</li>
	<li>Righteousness is not deeds or acts</li>
	<li>You are dead to sins</li>
	<li>Comes after the word Righteousness "by whose stripes you were healed"</li>
	<li>The more you live in the revelation of Righteousness, "by whose stripes you were healed" is no more a problem for you to appropriate</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>People used to use money which they don't have , to buy things which they don't need, to impress people who don't care</blockquote>
<h2>The Righteousness shall <span style="text-decoration: underline;">live</span> by faith</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Live : day to day necessary things</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 1:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “The just shall live by faith.”

<strong>Galatians 3:11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith.”

<strong>Hebrews 10:38</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

38 Now the just shall live by faith;
But if anyone draws back,
My soul has no pleasure in him.”

<strong>Isaiah 33:14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 The <strong>sinners in Zion are afraid</strong>;
Fearfulness has seized the hypocrites:
“Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?”
<ul>
	<li>The Righteousness shall live by faith</li>
	<li>Similar to, sinner shall live by fear</li>
	<li>Gods pattern: Righteousness by Faith.
<ul>
	<li>many people are trying to have faith without knowing that they are Righteous</li>
	<li>you cannot know you are Righteous in Gods eyes and not have faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>New Testament talks more about Righteousness than any other blessing</li>
	<li>God wants us to focus on Righteousness, because that's where the battle is</li>
</ul>
<h2>Righteousness by faith</h2>
<strong>Romans 9:30-33</strong>

<strong>Present Condition of Israel</strong>

As a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

16 Therefore thus says the Lord God:

<h3>Righteousness of God in Christ</h3>

<h2>Zeal for God without Knowledge</h2>
<strong>Romans 10:1-13</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Israel Needs the Gospel</strong>

10 Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel[a] is that they may be saved. 2 For I bear them witness that they have a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>zeal</strong></span> for God, but <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>not according to knowledge</strong></span>. 3 For they being <span style="color: #666699;"><strong>ignorant of God’s righteousness</strong></span>, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God. 4 For <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Christ is the end of the law</strong></span> for righteousness to everyone who believes.

5 For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, “The man who does those things shall live by them.”[b] 6 But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’”[c] (that is, to bring Christ down from above) 7 or, “‘Who will descend into the abyss?’”[d] (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 8 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”[e] (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.”[f] 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”[g]

<strong>Hosea 4:6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 My people are destroyed for <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>lack of knowledge</strong></span>.
Because you have rejected knowledge,

Because you have forgotten the law of your God,
I also will forget your children.

<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

34 Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>do not have the knowledge</strong></span> of God. I speak this to your shame.
<h2>The glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Bible says that, today we see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>That's why Jesus was not satisfied when the women with the issue of blood touched His back, hem of His garment. He stopped and turned around</li>
	<li>He wants her to look in to His eyes to see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>Because if she goes with the healing, in the matter of months she might fall sick again, Because the very root of the problem is not resolved</li>
	<li>She must know Gods love for her</li>
	<li>She must know Gods acceptance for her</li>
	<li>She must know Gods declaration of Her saying "Daughter, be of good comfort. Your faith has made you well"</li>
	<li>Then she can go away knowing she has not only received healing, but she has met Jesus and know something about His love for her and that will cure you permanently</li>
</ul>
<strong>2 Corinthians 4:6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</strong></span>.

You shall condemn.

<h2>Hearing of faith</h2>
<strong>Galatians 3:1-10</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Justification by Faith</strong>

3 O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified? 2 This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 3 Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh? 4 Have you suffered so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain?

5 Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?— 6 just as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” 7 Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>God would justify the Gentiles by faith</strong></span>, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, “<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>In you all the nations shall be blessed</strong></span>.” 9 So then those <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>who are of faith are blessed</strong></span> with believing Abraham.

<strong>The Law Brings a Curse</strong>

10 For <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse</strong></span>; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.”
<ul>
	<li>Whole passage is all about Justification by faith, in the context ( <strong><span style="color: #800080;">God would justify the Gentiles by faith</span> )</strong></li>
	<li>Miracles happen when you have the hearing of faith</li>
	<li>People have received some blessings by keeping the law. But the greatest blessing Holy Spirit received by hearing of faith.</li>
	<li>Present continuous tense in Greek : <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>supplies</strong> </span>the Spirit to you and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>works</strong> </span>miracles among you</li>
	<li>Revival stops because laws were introduced, not because of sin (verb)</li>
	<li>hearing the faith of righteousness</li>
	<li>Primary blessing of Abraham is Righteousness. Healing, wealth.. are bi-products of righteousness</li>
	<li><span style="color: #808000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"who are of faith are blessed"</span>. "as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse"</strong></span></li>
	<li>It <strong>doesn't</strong> say "as many as who breaks the law are under the curse"</li>
</ul>
<strong>James 5:14-16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>prayer of faith</strong></span> will <strong><span style="color: #008000;">save the sick</span></strong>, and the Lord will raise him up. And <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven</strong></span>. 16 Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.
<ul>

<h2>Why no restoration in the body of Christ?</h2>
<strong>Galatians 6:1</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Bear and Share the Burdens</strong>

6 Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted.
<ul>
	<li>Spiritual people --&gt; Restore</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>we are saved by grace through faith - spirit, soul, body</li>
	<li>rapture and the new body goes together</li>
	<li>It not because of our deeds we get the new body, its because of Jesus blood on the cross we get the new body</li>
	<li>Coming to Church doesn't makes you Christian, its receiving Jesus as your saviour and Lord.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The more someone believes that they are Justified by faith, the more things they do for God - Charles Spurgeon</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Good works are the fruit, bi product of the faith</li>
	<li>Self control is the fruit of the teaching of grace
<ul>
	<li>If you need to bring self control to someone, preach the Gospel of Grace to produce the fruit of self control, according to bible ( don't preach how to be in self control, they comes under works of the law category)</li>
</ul>
