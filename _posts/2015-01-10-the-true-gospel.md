<h2>Jude's Earnest letter</h2>
<strong>Jude 1:3-4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Contend for the Faith</strong>

3 Beloved, while I was <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">very diligent</span></strong> to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>necessary</strong></span> to write to you exhorting you to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>contend earnestly</strong></span> for <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>the faith</strong></span> which was once for all delivered to the saints.

4 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>For</strong></span> certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>turn</strong> </span>the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span style="color: #800080;"><strong>turn</strong> </span>= Replacement : <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>metatithemi</strong> </span>in Greek ( <a title="metatithemi" href="http://biblehub.com/greek/3346.htm" target="_blank">http://biblehub.com/greek/3346.htm</a> ) 5 more occurrences

licentiousness = lewdness
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>the faith</strong> </span>= Justification by Faith</li>
	<li>Gospel = Justification by Faith</li>
	<li>It's not mainly about Holiness, its about Justification</li>
	<li>Jude is very diligent, felt necessary and content earnestly because (<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>for</strong></span>), certain men have crept in unnoticed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Power of God</h2>
<strong>Romans 1:16-17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Just Live by Faith</strong>

16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>power of God</strong></span> to <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>salvation</strong></span> for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.

17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>faith to faith</strong></span>; as it is written, “The just shall live by faith.”
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Salvation</strong></span> : every blessing</li>

<h2>Seek "His" Righteousness</h2>
<strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> righteousness</strong></span>; and all these things shall be added unto you.
<h2>During the time of Jesus</h2>
<strong>Mark 2:16-17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”</strong></span>

17 When Jesus heard it, He said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”
<ul>
	<li>Accusing Jesus that He is promoting sinners. Others said "He is compromising", "He is eating with sinner", "How can He allow the women to touch him"</li>
	<li>They pretend as if they are holy</li>
	<li>Same accusation we have currently, that people say that the Gospel gives rights for people to sin</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Spirit and The Word</h2>
<ul>
	<li>New Born Christians : Tend to say "Jesus told me this, Jesus told me that"</li>
	<li>Word only Christians : They know only word, their heart is not for God</li>
	<li>We should know the Author and the Word</li>
	<li>All Spirit no Word : problem</li>
	<li>All Word no Spirit : problem</li>
	<li>All Word all Spirit you grow up</li>

<h2>The whole Counsel of God</h2>
<strong>Paul before he die, to the leaders ( Leadership Sermon )</strong>

<strong>Acts 20:24</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself,[a] so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>gospel of the grace of God</strong></span>.

<strong>Acts 20:25-32</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

25 “And indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. 26 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. 27 For I have not shunned to declare to you <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the whole counsel of God</strong></span>. 28 Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>church of God which He purchased with His own blood</strong></span>. 29 For I know this, that after my departure <strong>savage wolves</strong> will come in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking <strong>perverse things</strong>, to draw away the disciples after themselves. 31 Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.
32 “So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the word of His grace</strong></span>, which is <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">able to build you up</span></strong> and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>give you an inheritance</strong></span> among all those who are sanctified.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the whole counsel of God</strong></span> sandwiched between grace</li>

<h2>The Whole Armor of God</h2>
<strong>Ephesians 6:10-17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. 13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>evil day</strong></span>, and having done all, to stand.

14 Stand therefore, having girded your waist with <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>truth</strong></span>, having put on the breastplate of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>righteousness</strong></span>, 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the gospel of peace</strong></span>; 16 above all, taking the shield of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>faith</strong></span> with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. 17 And take the helmet of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>salvation</strong></span>, and the sword of the Spirit, which is <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the word of God</strong></span>; <span class="versenum">18 </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>praying always</strong> </span>with all prayer and supplication <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>in the Spirit</strong></span>, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints—
<h2>Paul's Ministry in Antioch, Iconium, Lystra</h2>
<blockquote>Paul Travelled from Antioch to Iconium and to Lystra</blockquote>
<h3>At Iconium</h3>
<strong>Acts 14:1-7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed. 2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren. 3 Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who was <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>bearing witness to the word of His grace</strong></span>, granting <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>signs and wonders</strong></span> to be done by their hands.

4 But the multitude of the city was divided: part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles. 5 And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to abuse and stone them, 6 they became aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region. 7 And they were preaching the gospel there.
<h3>At Lystra</h3>
<strong>Acts 14:8-10</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had never walked. 9 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>This man heard Paul speaking</strong></span>. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed, 10 said with a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” And he leaped and walked.
<h3>At Antioch</h3>
<strong>Acts 13:38-45</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

38 Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through this <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Man</strong> </span>is preached to you the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>forgiveness of sins</strong></span>; 39 and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>by Him</strong> </span><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>everyone</strong> </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>who believes</strong></span> is <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>justified</strong> </span>from <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>all things</strong></span> <strong>from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses</strong>. 40 Beware therefore, lest what has been spoken in the prophets come upon you:

41 ‘Behold, you despisers,
Marvel and perish!
For I work a work in your days,
A <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>work*</strong></span> which you will by no means believe,
Though one were to declare it to you.’”
<h4>Blessing and Conflict at Antioch</h4>
42 So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Gentiles begged</strong></span> that <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>these words</strong></span> might be preached to them the next Sabbath. 43 Now when the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>congregation had broken up</strong></span>, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>continue in the grace of God</strong></span>.

44 On the next Sabbath <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>almost the whole city came together</strong></span> <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>to hear the word of God</strong></span>. 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, <strong>they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they opposed the things spoken by Paul</strong>.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>* work</strong></span> = Marvellous work in Issaiah</li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>these words</strong> </span>= same words</li>
</ul>
<h3>At Jerusalem</h3>
<strong>Acts 15:1-11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h4>Conflict over Circumcision</h4>
15 And <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>certain men came down from Judea</strong></span> and taught the brethren, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.” 2 Therefore, when <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute</strong></span> with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.

3 So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>they caused great joy to all the brethren</strong></span>. 4 And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were <span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>received by the church and the apostles and the elders</strong></span>; and they reported all things that God had done with them. 5 But some of the <strong>sect</strong> of the Pharisees <strong>who believed</strong> rose up, saying, <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>“It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.”</strong></span>
<h4>The Jerusalem Council</h4>
6 Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter. 7 And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up and said to them: “Men and brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the word of the gospel and believe</strong></span>. 8 So God, who knows the heart, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit</strong></span>, <strong>just as He did to us</strong>, 9 and made <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>no distinction between us and them</strong></span>, purifying their hearts <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>by faith</strong></span>. 10 Now therefore, <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>why do you <span style="color: #ff00ff;">test</span> God by putting a yoke</strong></span> on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ <strong>we shall be saved in the same manner as they</strong>.”
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #008000;">certain men came down from Judea :</span> </strong>Men from James's church ( James: Half Brother of Jesus ) ( James not as good in Gospel as Paul and Barnabas )</li>
	<li><span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute </strong></span>: Means Big dispute (Same kind of disputes is seen even now a days)</li>
	<li><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>received by the church and the apostles and the elders : </strong></span>Gospel is a sermon to everyone on everyone becoming apostles and leaders ( leadership meeting )</li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #333399;">“It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.”</span> : </strong>Trying to Mix Law and Grace</li>
	<li><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>no distinction between us and them : </strong></span>No Distinction from Jews and Gentiles through Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>purifying their hearts <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>by faith</strong></span></li>
	<li><strong>we shall be saved in the same manner as they : </strong> Jews and Gentiles will get saved in the same manner.</li>
	<li>Last time Peter's name is mentioned in the book of Acts
<ul>
	<li>after that Paul all the way</li>
	<li>Early church Initially was only Jews, then Jews and Gentiles, then its for Gentiles ( Paul reached out to Gentiles )</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">why do you </span><span style="color: #ff00ff;">test</span> <span style="color: #3366ff;">God by putting a yoke</span></strong>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>yoke</strong></span> represents the full laws ( it doesn't make sense if it's about circumcision because Jews get circumcised when they were 8 days old, and on 8th day there is nothing for them to be burden about. 8 days old kids barely remember anything : So this is about the Full law )</li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>tempt</strong></span> same word for <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>test</strong></span> in Greek</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>1 Corinthians 10:9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

9 nor let us <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>tempt</strong></span> Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents;

<strong>Matthew 11:28-30</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

28 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>My yoke is easy and My burden is light</strong></span>.”

<strong>Acts 15:12-29</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 Then all the multitude <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>kept silent</strong></span> and listened to Barnabas and Paul <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>declaring how many miracles and wonders</strong></span> God had worked through them among the Gentiles. 13 And after they had become silent, James answered, saying, “Men and brethren, listen to me: 14 Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name. 15 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:

16 ‘After this I will return
And will rebuild the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>tabernacle of David</strong></span>, which has fallen down;
I will rebuild its ruins,
And I will set it up;
17 So that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,
<strong>Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name</strong>,
Says the Lord who does all these things.’
18 “Known to God from eternity are all His works. 19 Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God, 20 but that we write to them to <span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and from blood</strong></span>. 21 For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”
<h3>The Jerusalem Decree</h3>
22 Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.

23 They wrote this letter by them:

The apostles, the elders, and the brethren,

To the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:

Greetings.

24 Since we have heard that some who went out from us have <span style="color: #666699;"><strong>troubled you with words</strong></span>, <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>unsettling your souls</strong></span>, saying, “You must be circumcised and keep the law” —to whom we gave no such commandment— 25 it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth. 28 For it seemed <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">good to the Holy Spirit</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things</span></strong>: 29 <span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality</strong></span>. If you keep yourselves from these, you<strong> will do well.</strong>

43 To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.”
<h3><strong>The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles</strong></h3>
44 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word</strong></span>. 45 And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. 46 For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.

Then Peter answered, 47 “Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” 48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.
<ul>
	<li>As soon as Peter was preaching above verse, Holy Spirit fell.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Acts 11:1-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Peter Defends God’s Grace</strong>

11 Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 2 And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him, 3 saying, “You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”

4 But Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning, saying: 5 “I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me. 6 When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. 7 And I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Rise, Peter; kill and eat.’ 8 But I said, ‘Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.’ 9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, ‘What God has cleansed you must not call common.’ 10 Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven. 11 At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. 12 Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house. 13 And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, ‘Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter, 14 who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.’ 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. 16 Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, ‘John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ 17 If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?”

18 When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, “Then God has also <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>granted</strong> </span>to the Gentiles <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">repentance to life</span>.</strong>”
