<strong>2 Corinthians 4:3-6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,
4 whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them</strong></span>.
5 For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus’ sake.
6 For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the light (Jews)</strong></span> of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the knowledge (Greeks)</strong></span> of <strong>the<span style="color: #008000;"> glory (Romans)</span></strong> of God in the <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>face of Jesus Christ</strong></span>.
<h2>First what God spoke?</h2>

	<li>In Hebrew it means <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Let Jesus be the Light</span></strong></li>
	<li>You might think it is sun light, but sun was created on the 4th day.</li>
</ul>
<strong>John 8:1-12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

2 Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them.
3 Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>they had set her in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">midst</span></strong>,</span>
4 they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.
5 Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?”
6 This they said, <strong>testing Him</strong>, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>wrote on the ground with His finger</strong></span>, as though He did not hear.

7 So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.”
8 <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.</strong></span>
9 Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>went out one by one, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beginning with the oldest even to the last</span></strong></span>. And Jesus was left alone, and the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>woman standing in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">midst</span></strong></span>.
10 When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, “Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?”

11 She said, “No one, Lord.”

And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.”

12 Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I am the light of the world</strong></span>. He who <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>follows Me</strong></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>shall not</strong></span> walk in darkness, but have the light of life.”

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>SHALL NOT</strong></span> : Double negative in Greek

<strong>John 8:56-59</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.”

57 Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?”

58 Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.”

59 Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>going through the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">midst</span> of them</strong></span>, and so passed by.
<ul>
	<li>Start with the stones, end with the stones</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">It begun with sin in the centre, it ends with Jesus in the centre (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff00ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Midst</strong></span></span>)</span></li>
	<li>We are supposed to be punished, but Jesus took our punishment. Crucifixion on the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>midst</strong></span>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wrote with His finger</h2>
<strong>Exodus 31:18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

18 And when He had made an end of speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>written with the finger of God</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>Jesus wrote on the ground with His finger ( John 8:6 above )</li>
	<li>Jesus is to say I am the one who gave the Commandments</li>
</ul>
<strong>Jeremiah 17:13</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 O Lord, the hope of Israel,
All who forsake You shall be ashamed.
“Those who depart from Me
Shall be written in the earth,
Because they have forsaken the Lord,
The fountain of living waters.”
<ul>
	<li>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. ( John 8:8 above )</li>
	<li>Jesus would have started writing their names and their sins on the ground ( Above prophesy fulfilled Jeremiah 17:13)</li>
	<li>That would have made them to leave <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>one by one</strong></span> (John 8:9 above), because while writing we can't write all the names at once right? so Jesus would have written their names one by one.</li>
</ul>
