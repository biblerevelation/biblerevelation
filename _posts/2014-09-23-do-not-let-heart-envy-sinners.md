<strong>Proverbs 23:17-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not let your heart envy sinners</strong></span>,
But be zealous for the fear of the Lord all the day;
18 For surely there is a hereafter,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>your hope will not be cut off</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 24:1-2</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

1 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not be envious of evil men</strong></span>,
Nor desire to be with them;
2 For their heart devises violence,
And their lips talk of troublemaking.

<strong>Proverbs 24:13-14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 My son, eat honey because it is good,
And the honeycomb which is sweet to your taste;
14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul;
If you have found it, there is a prospect,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>your hope will not be cut off</strong></span>.
