<strong>Proverbs 3:19-20</strong>
New King James Version (NKJV)

19 The Lord by <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>wisdom</strong> </span>founded the earth;
By <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>understanding</strong> </span>He established the heavens;
20 By His <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>knowledge</strong> </span>the depths were broken up,
And clouds drop down the dew.
