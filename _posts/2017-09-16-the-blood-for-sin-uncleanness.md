<h2>Fountain of blood</h2>
<p class="passage-display"><span class="passage-display-bcv">Zechariah 13:1
</span><span class="passage-display-version">World English Bible (WEB)</span></p>
<p class="chapter-2"><span id="en-WEB-23061" class="text Zech-13-1"><span class="chapternum">13 </span>“In that day there will be a spring opened to David’s house <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>( The Church )</strong></span> and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.</span></p>
spring = Blood ( The Blood of Jesus Christ )
<ul>
 	<li>sin = Missing the Mark</li>
 	<li>Uncleanness = Wrong deeds in your thought , word and action</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Power in the Blood of Christ</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Stops us from Missing the mark in health and healing</li>
 	<li>Stops us from Missing the mark in Provision</li>
</ul>
