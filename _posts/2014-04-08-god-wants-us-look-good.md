<h3>Luke 2:52</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #9245ba;"><strong>stature</strong></span>, and in favor with God and man.</blockquote>
<div>

King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<blockquote>52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #8742bc;"><strong>stature</strong></span></span>, and in favour with God and man.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>We all know that We have to Grow in wisdom, in favor with God and man ( we have to ask God for Wisdom, favor )</li>
	<li>Profound thing is that the above verse also says "<strong><span style="color: #8742bc;">stature</span></strong>"</li>
	<li>Shows the <strong>IMPORTANCE</strong> of Stature as well</li>
	<li>Clearly understandable that God want's us also to Grow tall physically</li>
	<li>Clearly says that <strong>God wants us to look good</strong>.</li>
	<li>Ask, and it shall be given unto you ( Matthew 7:7 ) ,  May He grant you <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>according</strong></span> to <strong>YOUR</strong> heart’s <span style="color: #339966;"><strong><em>desire</em></strong></span> ( Psalm 20:4 NIV )</li>
</ul>
