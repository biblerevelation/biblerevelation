<h2>Answer for how Jesus could reveal Himself to you</h2>
<h3><strong>John 9</strong></h3>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h2><strong>A Man Born Blind Receives Sight</strong></h2>
<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text John-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>Now as <i>Jesus</i> passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26443" class="text John-9-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>And His disciples asked Him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”</span></p>
<span id="en-NKJV-26444" class="text John-9-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">“<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him</strong></span>.</span> </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26445" class="text John-9-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup><span class="woj">I</span><span class="woj"> must work the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>works of Him</strong></span> who sent Me while it is day; <i>the</i> night is coming when no one can work.</span> </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26446" class="text John-9-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup><span class="woj">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26447" class="text John-9-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>When He had said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26448" class="text John-9-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And He said to him, <span class="woj">“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which is translated, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26449" class="text John-9-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Therefore the neighbors and those who previously had seen that he was blind said, “Is not this he who sat and begged?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26450" class="text John-9-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Some said, “This is he.” Others <i>said,</i> “He is like him.”</span>

<span class="text John-9-9">He said, “I am <i>he.</i>”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26451" class="text John-9-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Therefore they said to him, “How were your eyes opened?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26452" class="text John-9-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>He answered and said, “A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, <span class="woj">‘Go to the pool of</span><span class="woj"> Siloam and wash.’</span> So I went and washed, and I received sight.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26453" class="text John-9-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then they said to him, “Where is He?”</span>

<span class="text John-9-12">He said, “I do not know.”</span>
<h3><span id="en-NKJV-26454" class="text John-9-13">The Pharisees Excommunicate the Healed Man</span></h3>
<span class="text John-9-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26455" class="text John-9-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Now <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>it was a Sabbath</strong></span> when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26456" class="text John-9-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26457" class="text John-9-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Therefore some of the Pharisees said, “This Man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.”</span>

<span class="text John-9-16">Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And there was a division among them.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26458" class="text John-9-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>They said to the blind man again, “What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes?”</span>

<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span class="text John-9-17">He said, “He is a prophet.”</span></strong></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26459" class="text John-9-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26460" class="text John-9-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And they asked them, saying, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26461" class="text John-9-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>His parents answered them and said, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26462" class="text John-9-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>but by what means he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He will speak for himself.” </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26463" class="text John-9-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>His parents said these <i>things</i> because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed <i>that</i> He <i>was</i> Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26464" class="text John-9-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26465" class="text John-9-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>So they again called the man who was blind, and said to him, “Give God the glory! We know that this Man is a sinner.”</span>

<span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong><span id="en-NKJV-26466" class="text John-9-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner <i>or not</i> I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</span></strong></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26467" class="text John-9-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>Then they said to him again, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26468" class="text John-9-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>He answered them, “I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear <i>it</i> again? Do you also want to become His disciples?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26469" class="text John-9-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Then they reviled him and said, “You are His disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26470" class="text John-9-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>We know that God spoke to Moses; <i>as for</i> this <i>fellow,</i> we do not know where He is from.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26471" class="text John-9-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>The man answered and said to them, “Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes! </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26472" class="text John-9-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26473" class="text John-9-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-26474" class="text John-9-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26475" class="text John-9-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>They answered and said to him, “You were completely born in sins, and are you teaching us?” And they cast him out.</span>
<h3><span id="en-NKJV-26476" class="text John-9-35">True Vision and True Blindness</span></h3>
<span class="text John-9-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">He had found him</span></strong>, He said to him, <span class="woj">“<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do you believe in the Son of God?</strong></span>”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26477" class="text John-9-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>He answered and said, “Who is He, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Lord</strong></span>, that I may believe in Him?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26478" class="text John-9-37"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">“<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>You have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you</strong></span>.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26479" class="text John-9-38"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Then he said, “<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Lord, I believe</strong></span>!” And he worshiped Him.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26480" class="text John-9-39"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>And Jesus said, <span class="woj">“For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may be made blind.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26481" class="text John-9-40"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Then <i>some</i> of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, “Are we blind also?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26482" class="text John-9-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span></span>
