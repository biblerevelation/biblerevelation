<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Acts 3:13-20
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-27010" class="text Acts-3-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let <i>Him</i> go. </span><span id="en-NKJV-27011" class="text Acts-3-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, </span><span id="en-NKJV-27012" class="text Acts-3-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. </span><span id="en-NKJV-27013" class="text Acts-3-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which <i>comes</i> through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-27014" class="text Acts-3-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>“Yet now, brethren, I know that you did <i>it</i> in ignorance, as <i>did</i> also your rulers. </span><span id="en-NKJV-27015" class="text Acts-3-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled. </span><span id="en-NKJV-27016" class="text Acts-3-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, </span><span id="en-NKJV-27017" class="text Acts-3-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before,</span>
<h2><strong>What is Repentance in this passage?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Before</strong></h3>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jews used to think :</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span id="en-NKJV-27011" class="text Acts-3-14">Denied the Holy One and the Just, and </span></li>
	<li><span id="en-NKJV-27011" class="text Acts-3-14">asked for a murderer to be granted to you, </span></li>
	<li><span id="en-NKJV-27012" class="text Acts-3-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>and </span><span id="en-NKJV-27012" class="text Acts-3-15">killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>After</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Accept the Holy One, and the Just</li>
	<li>Accept Jesus is the Prince of Life</li>
</ul>
Changing your mind from <strong>Before</strong> to <strong>After</strong> is called Repentance
<ul>
	<li>Repentance means Change of Mind.</li>
</ul>
