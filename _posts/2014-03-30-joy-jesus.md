<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #b037c7;">Jesus "Endured" the Cross</span></strong> for this Joy</li>
	<li>Jesus <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">sold all He had</span></strong> (He gave himself) for this Joy</li>
</ul>
Shows that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>highest priority</strong></span> for Jesus is this Joy

this Joy is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MAKING US HAPPY</strong></span> by
<ul>
	<li>freeing us from sins (making us righteous, which takes us to heaven)</li>
	<li>freeing us from diseases</li>
	<li>freeing us from crying</li>
	<li>giving us peace</li>
	<li>giving us Joy</li>
</ul>
