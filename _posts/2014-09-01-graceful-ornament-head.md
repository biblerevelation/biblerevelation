<strong>Proverbs 1:8-9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 My son, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>hear the instruction of your father</strong></span>,
And <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">do not forsake the law of your mother</span></strong>;

9 For they will be a <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>graceful ornament on your head</strong></span>,
And chains about your neck.
