<h2>Hear "HIM", not them</h2>
<strong>Matthew 17:1-13</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<strong> Jesus Transfigured on the Mount</strong>

17 Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, led them up on a high mountain by themselves; 2 and He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. 4 Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>tabernacles</strong></span>: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”

5 While he was still speaking, behold, a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>bright cloud</strong></span> overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!” 6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid. 7 But Jesus <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>came</strong> </span>and <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>touched them</strong></span> and <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>said</strong></span>, “<strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">Arise</span>, and do not be afraid</strong>.” 8 When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw <span style="color: #cc99ff;"><strong>no one but Jesus only</strong></span>.

9 Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.”

10 And His disciples asked Him, saying, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”

11 Jesus answered and said to them, “Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things. 12 But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise the Son of Man is also about to suffer at their hands.” 13 Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Baptist.

<span class="text Luke-9-51"><sup class="versenum">51 </sup>Now it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be received up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem, </span> <span id="en-NKJV-25354" class="text Luke-9-52"><sup class="versenum">52 </sup>and sent messengers before His face.

<h2>Depart</h2>
<h3><strong>Departing of Moses ( Failure )

<h3>Departing of Jesus ( Accomplish )</h3>
<strong>Luke 9:31</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

31 who appeared in glory and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>spoke of His decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>Didn't talk about death overtaking</li>
	<li>Accomplish means power over death. Jesus overtaking death</li>
	<li>decease means exodus ( leaving/depart this world )</li>

<strong>Isaiah 42:1-4</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<strong>The Servant of the Lord</strong>

42 “Behold! My Servant whom I uphold,
My Elect One in whom My soul delights!
I have put My Spirit upon Him;
He will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.
2 He will not cry out, nor raise His voice,
Nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.
3 A bruised reed He will not break,
And smoking flax He will not quench;
He will bring forth justice for truth.
4 He will <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>not fail (Moses)</strong> <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>nor be discouraged (Elijah)</strong></span></span>,
Till He has established justice in the earth;
And the coastlands shall wait for His law.”
<ul>
	<li>Before the crown He has to go down and suffer on the other mountain ( Hermon to Golgotha )</li>
	<li>Before they can have three bulls there must be three crosses on another mountain ( this LINE IS NOT CLEAR )</li>
	<li>Before he flank in glory by Elijah and Moses, he must be flank among another mountain Golgotha by two thieves in shame</li>
	<li>Before His face shone, His face has to be spat.</li>
	<li>THIS THE DISCIPLES Didn't UNDERSTAND ( why He has to go down? )</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Jesus received honor and glory?</h3>
<strong>2 Peter 1:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”

<strong>2 Peter 1:16-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<strong> The Trustworthy Prophetic Word</strong>

16 For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. 17 For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” 18 And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.

<strong>Isaiah 11:6-9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
The leopard shall lie down with the young goat,
The calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
And a little child shall lead them.
7 The cow and the bear shall graze;
Their young ones shall lie down together;
And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
8 The nursing child shall play by the cobra’s hole,
And the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper’s den.
9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain,
For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord
As the waters cover the sea.
