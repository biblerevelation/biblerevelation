<strong><span id="en-NKJV-23338" class="text Matt-7-21">I Never Knew You</span></strong>

<span class="text Matt-7-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup><span class="woj">“<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven</span></strong>, but he who does <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>the will of My Father</strong></span> in heaven.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-23339" class="text Matt-7-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup><span class="woj"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Many will say</strong></span> to Me <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>in that day</strong></span>, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-23340" class="text Matt-7-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup><span class="woj">And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’</span></span>
<h2><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>In that day</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>The Day when Jesus return.</li>
	<li>Second Coming of Christ</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Time when every knows Jesus is Lord</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Obviously everyone will call Him Lord, despite of whether they received Jesus or not before.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #333399;">They said</span> </strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus didn't say</li>
	<li>It could be a lie.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What is <span style="color: #3366ff;">the Will of the Father</span></strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Today ( <strong>NOT "<span style="color: #008000;">IN THAT DAY</span>"</strong> ), if you call Him Lord, You believe in Him in your heart, you are doing the will of the Father.</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">John 6:40

<span id="en-NKJV-26298" class="text John-6-40"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup><span class="woj">And <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>this is the will of Him</strong></span> who sent Me, that <strong>everyone who sees the Son</strong> and believes in Him may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”</span></span>
<ul>
	<li>Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>now</strong></span>. NOT <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>in that day</strong></span></li>
	<li>During sermon which unveils Christ, they see Jesus, they believe in Him and they are saved.</li>
