<strong>Proverbs 19:23</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

23 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>The fear of the Lord</strong></span> leads to life,
And he who has it will abide in satisfaction;
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He will not be visited with evil</strong></span>.
