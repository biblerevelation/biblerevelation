<h2 class="passage-display"><strong>Solomon getting all he wants ( "I" centered )</strong></h2>
<p class="passage-display"><strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Ecclesiastes 2:1-11
</span><span class="passage-display-version">World English Bible (WEB)</span></strong></p>
<p class="chapter-1"><span id="en-WEB-17335" class="text Eccl-2-1"><span class="chapternum">2 </span>I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with mirth: therefore enjoy pleasure”; and behold, this also was vanity. </span><span id="en-WEB-17336" class="text Eccl-2-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>I said of laughter, “It is foolishness”; and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?”</span></p>
<span id="en-WEB-17337" class="text Eccl-2-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup><strong>I searched</strong> in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their lives. </span><span id="en-WEB-17338" class="text Eccl-2-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup><strong>I made</strong> myself great works. I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards. </span><span id="en-WEB-17339" class="text Eccl-2-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup><strong>I made</strong> myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit. </span><span id="en-WEB-17340" class="text Eccl-2-6"><sup class="versenum">6<strong> </strong></sup><strong>I made</strong> myself pools of water, to water from it the forest where trees were reared. </span><span id="en-WEB-17341" class="text Eccl-2-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup><strong>I bought</strong> male servants and female servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem; </span><span id="en-WEB-17342" class="text Eccl-2-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. <strong>I got</strong> myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men—musical instruments, and that of all sorts. </span><span id="en-WEB-17343" class="text Eccl-2-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So <strong>I was great</strong>, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me. </span><span id="en-WEB-17344" class="text Eccl-2-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Whatever my eyes desired, I didn’t keep from them. I didn’t withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor. </span><span id="en-WEB-17345" class="text Eccl-2-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</span>
<h3><strong>Result</strong></h3>
<p class="passage-display"><strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Ecclesiastes 2:17
</span><span class="passage-display-version">World English Bible (WEB)</span></strong></p>
<span id="en-WEB-17351" class="text Eccl-2-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>So <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I hated </strong></span>life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</span>
