<p style="color: #000000;"><span class="text Mark-5-21"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">21 </span>Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea. </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24387" class="text Mark-5-22"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">22 </span>And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24388" class="text Mark-5-23"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">23 </span>and begged Him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.” </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24389" class="text Mark-5-24"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">24 </span>So <i>Jesus</i> went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>thronged Him</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24390" class="text Mark-5-25"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">25 </span>Now a certain woman had a flow of blood for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>twelve years</strong></span>, </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24391" class="text Mark-5-26"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">26 </span>and had suffered many things from many <strong>physicians</strong>. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse. </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24392" class="text Mark-5-27"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">27 </span>When <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>she heard <span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">about</span> Jesus</strong></span>, she came behind <i>Him</i> in the crowd and touched His garment. </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24393" class="text Mark-5-28"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">28 </span>For she said, “If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.”</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24394" class="text Mark-5-29"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">29 </span>Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in <i>her</i> body that she was healed of the affliction. </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24395" class="text Mark-5-30"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">30 </span>And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, <span class="woj">“Who touched My clothes?”</span></span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24396" class="text Mark-5-31"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">31 </span>But His disciples said to Him, “You see the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>multitude thronging</strong></span> You, and You say,<span class="woj">‘Who touched Me?’</span>”</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24397" class="text Mark-5-32"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">32 </span>And He looked around to see her who had done this thing. </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24398" class="text Mark-5-33"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">33 </span>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-24399" class="text Mark-5-34"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">34 </span>And He said to her, <span class="woj">“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.”</span></span></p>
<span id="en-NKJV-24400" class="text Mark-5-35"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">35 </span>While He was still speaking, <i>some</i> came from the ruler of the synagogue’s <i>house</i> who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24401" class="text Mark-5-36"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">36 </span>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span class="woj">“Do not be afraid; only believe.”</span> </strong></span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24402" class="text Mark-5-37"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">37 </span>And He permitted no one to follow Him except <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Peter, James, and John</strong></span> the brother of James. </span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24403" class="text Mark-5-38"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">38 </span>Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24404" class="text Mark-5-39"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">39 </span>When He came in, He said to them, <span class="woj">“Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24405" class="text Mark-5-40"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">40 </span>And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those <i>who were</i> with Him, and entered where the child was lying. </span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24406" class="text Mark-5-41"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">41 </span>Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, <span class="woj">“Talitha, cumi,”</span> which is translated, <span class="woj">“Little girl, I say to you, arise.”</span> </span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24407" class="text Mark-5-42"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">42 </span>Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>twelve years</strong></span> <i>of age.</i> And they were overcome with great amazement. </span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24408" class="text Mark-5-43"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">43 </span>But He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that <span style="color: #339966;"><strong><i>something</i> should be given her to eat</strong>.</span></span>

<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-3188" class="text Lev-15-19"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">19 </span>‘If a woman has a discharge, <i>and</i> the discharge from her body is blood, she shall be set apart seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening. </span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-3189" class="text Lev-15-20"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">20 </span>Everything that she lies on during her impurity shall be unclean; also everything that she sits on shall be unclean. </span></p>

<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-3191" class="text Lev-15-22"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">22 </span>And whoever touches anything that she sat on shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. </span></p>

<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-NKJV-3193" class="text Lev-15-24"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">24 </span>And if any man lies with her at all, so that her impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.</span></p>

She <i>shall be</i> unclean.</span></p>

<h3 style="color: #000000;">How she received Healing?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Leviticus 15:19-25 says about what a woman with discharge of blood cannot do (Law)</li>
	<li>She cannot touch anyone as per Law</li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>She heard <span style="color: #0000ff;">about</span> Jesus</strong></span></li>
	<li>Whatever she heard about Jesus is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not about Law</strong></span></li>
	<li>That initiated her to <strong>touch</strong> Jesus</li>
</ul>
<h3>Active Healing</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This is Active Healing ( She initiated the healing )</li>
	<li>We are in same situation as her : So we have to initiate healing</li>
	<li>We are in same situation: we are on earth, where Jesus is in Heaven and Healing is always available for free.</li>
	<li>so, we have to receive Healing actively ( we have to initiate )</li>
	<li>Jesus called her daughter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multitudes Thronging</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Thronging = Many People toughing Jesus</li>
	<li>Multitudes were not able to receive healing</li>
	<li>Multitudes only know about the Law</li>
	<li>Multitudes didn't hear about Jesus (Non Law)</li>
