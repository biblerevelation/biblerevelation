<h2>1. Fig Tree represents Self Righteousness</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It started in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Even took Fig leaves to cover their nakedness, once after they sin</li>
	<li>Jesus curses a fig tree</li>
	<li>All sinners received healing from Jesus, except pharisees and Sadducees who believed on Self righteousness by keeping the commandments / law</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jesus Curses a fig tree</h3>
<div>
<h3>Mark 11:13-14</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.

14 Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.</blockquote>
<div>
<h3>Mark 11:20-22</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>20 In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.

21 Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!”

22 “Have faith in God,” Jesus answered.</blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1;">2. "Rich" Signifies Self Righteousness</span>
<h3><span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.0909090909;">Matthew 19:16-26</span> below</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus clearly replied "There is only <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One</strong></span> who is good" . One is Jesus Himself</li>
	<li>No one else can be Righteousness, unless and until it is by believing Jesus and what He did on the cross</li>
	<li>The man who came to Jesus was so much about his Self Righteousness and was boasting on his Self Righteousness</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">You will be Righteous only by believing on Jesus and on what He has done on the cross.  ( Not by your self righteousness : and so it says "seek ye first the Kingdom of God and </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>HIS</strong></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Righteousness ) </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" title="Can you become “Righteous” by Confessing all your sins and Plan to do no sin from now on? NO" href="http://biblerevelation.org/2014/03/27/can-you-become-righteous-by-confessing-all-your-sins/" target="_blank">more info</a></li>
	<li>It shows "with man it is impossible to be self righteous". Man has to rely on Jesus Righteousness. Hence New Covenant was made</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.0909090909;">Matthew 19:16-26</span>
<div>

New International Version (NIV)

</div>
<div>

16 Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?”

17 “Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>There is only One who is good</strong></span>. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”

18 “Which ones?” he inquired.

Jesus replied, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, 19 honor your father and mother,’ and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’”

20 “All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?”

21 Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”

22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.

23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rich</strong></span> to enter the kingdom of heaven.

24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rich</strong></span> to enter the kingdom of God.”

25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #808000;"><strong>Who then can be saved?</strong></span>”

26 Jesus looked at them and said, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible</strong></span>.”
