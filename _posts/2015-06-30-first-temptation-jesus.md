<h2>Turn Stone in to bread</h2>
<strong>Matthew 4:3-4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-23213" class="text Matt-4-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, “If You are the Son of God, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>command that these stones become bread</strong></span>.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23214" class="text Matt-4-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But He answered and said, <span class="woj">“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">word</span></strong> that proceeds from the mouth of God.’”</span></span>
<h2>Turn stone in to bread, implies</h2>
I believe,
<ul>
	<li><strong>Stone</strong> : Ten Commandments written on stone</li>
	<li><strong>Bread</strong> : Life</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>In other words, satan asked Jesus to get Life from the Ten Commandments and its not possible.</li>
	<li>We can't get Life from Ten Commandments</li>
	<li>Ten Commandments only brings death</li>
	<li><a href="http://biblerevelation.org/2014/03/19/10-commandments-ministry-death-bible/">Ten Commandments is called the Ministry of Death</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Reference of Jesus reply</h2>
<strong>Deuteronomy 8:3</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-5141" class="text Deut-8-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><i>word</i></strong></span> that proceeds from the mouth of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span>
<h2>What <span style="color: #ff00ff;">word</span>?</h2>
<strong> Matthew 3:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-23210" class="text Matt-3-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>And suddenly a voice <i>came</i> from heaven, saying, “<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</strong></span>.”</span>
