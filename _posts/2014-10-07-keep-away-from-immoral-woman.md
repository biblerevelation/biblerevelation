<strong>Proverbs 7:1-5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 My son, keep my words,
And treasure my commands within you.
2 Keep my commands and live,
And my law as the apple of your eye.
3 Bind them on your fingers;
Write them on the tablet of your heart.
4 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”</strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> And call understanding your nearest kin</strong></span>,
5 That they may keep you from the immoral woman,
From the seductress who flatters with her words.
