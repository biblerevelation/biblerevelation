<h3>Ephesians 5:28-29</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>28 Even so husbands should love their wives as [being in a sense] their own bodies. <strong><span style="color: #a23cc2;">He who loves his own wife loves himself</span></strong>.

29 For <strong>no man ever hated <span style="color: #0000ff;">his own flesh</span></strong>, but nourishes <i>and</i> carefully protects and cherishes it, <span style="color: #a23cc2;"><strong>as Christ does the church</strong></span>,</blockquote>
This "<strong><span style="color: #a23cc2;">He who loves his own wife loves himself</span></strong>" verse clearly shows that Jesus loves us as He loves Himself
<h2>Love of God</h2>
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>We are His own flesh</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>Nourishing us</li>
	<li>Carefully Protecting us</li>
	<li>Cherishing us (making us happy only)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Note:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We are the Church</li>
	<li>Christ is the Head</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Colossians 1:18</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</blockquote>
