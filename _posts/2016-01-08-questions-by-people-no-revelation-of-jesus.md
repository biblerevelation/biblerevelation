<strong><span id="en-NKJV-28070" class="text Rom-6-1">People with no revelation of Jesus asking</span></strong>
<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Rom-6-1"><span class="chapternum">6 </span>What shall we say then?

<ul>
	<li class="chapter-1">They didn't use the same word</li>
	<li class="chapter-1">They didn't understand what Paul was saying</li>

“How can the medicine that's supposed to kill the disease (grace) feed the disease (sin)?” - John Calvin
<ul>
	<li>Grace is not an empowerment, but it produces the empowerment.</li>
	<li>How it produces empowerment ? By the revelation of the Gift of no condemnation. That empowers to sin no more</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">John 8:10-12

<span id="en-NKJV-26392" class="text John-8-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, <span class="woj">“Woman, where are those accusers of yours?</span><span class="woj"> Has no one condemned you?”</span></span>

<span class="text John-8-11">And Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">“Neither do I condemn you; go and</span> <span class="woj">sin no more.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26394" class="text John-8-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, <span class="woj">“I am the light of the world. He who follows Me <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>shall not (ou - me : strong negative)</strong></span> walk in darkness, but have the light of life.”</span></span>
<ul>
