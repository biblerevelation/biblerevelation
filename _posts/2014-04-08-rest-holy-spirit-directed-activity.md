<h3>What is Holy Spirit Directed Activity?</h3>
<div>
<h3>Romans 7:5-6</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

</div>
<div>

5 When we <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>were</strong></span> living in the flesh (mere physical lives), the sinful passions that were awakened <i>and</i> aroused up by [what] the Law [makes sin] were constantly operating in our natural powers (in our bodily organs, in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh), so that we bore fruit for death.

6 But <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>now</strong></span> we are discharged from the Law <i>and</i> have terminated all intercourse with it, having died to what once restrained <i>and</i> held us captive. So now we serve not under [obedience to] the old code of written regulations, but [under <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ac41bd;"><strong>obedience to the promptings] of the Spirit</strong></span> in newness [of life].
<h2>Learning from our Emotions</h2>
<strong>Check out our emotions </strong>
<ul>
	<li>anger, depression.. are negative</li>
	<li>peace, happy .. are positive</li>
</ul>
negative means you are not resting in Jesus

</div>
<h2>Learning from Animals</h2>
<h3><strong>Long living animals:</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Camel</li>
	<li>Turtle</li>
</ul>
Reason: Silent, Quiet, Resting
<h3>Short living animals:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Cheetah</li>
</ul>
Reason: Mostly angry
<h3>Matthew 11:28 (AMP)</h3>
Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy-laden and overburdened, and I will cause you to rest. [I will ease and relieve and refresh your souls.] (I will rest you in Greek)

<b>Come to Me — Seek Him —&gt; Jesus will rest you</b>
<h3>You will find rest in Holy Spirit Directed Activity</h3>
