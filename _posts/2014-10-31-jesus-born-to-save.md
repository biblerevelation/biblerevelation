<strong>Matthew 2:1-11
New King James Version (NKJV)
Wise Men from the East</strong>

1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>wise men from the East</strong></span> came to Jerusalem, 2 saying, “<span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Where is He</strong></span> who has been born <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>King of the Jews</strong></span>? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.”

3 When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 And when he had gathered all the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>chief priests and scribes</strong></span> of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

5 So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:

6 ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
Are not the least among the rulers of Judah;
For out of you shall come a Ruler
Who will shepherd My people Israel.’”

7 Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared. 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also.”

9 When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. 11 And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

<h2>Prophesy by Micah</h2>

The Coming Messiah</strong>

2 “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
Though you are little among the thousands of Judah,
Yet out of you shall come forth to Me
The One to be Ruler in Israel,
Whose goings forth are from of old,
From everlasting.”
<h2>Immanuel</h2>

23 “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Immanuel</strong></span>,” which is translated, “God with us.”

<strong>Genesis 39:1-6
New King James Version (NKJV)
Joseph a Slave in Egypt
</strong>
39 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there. 2 The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 3 And his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all he did to prosper in his hand. 4 So Joseph found favor in his sight, and served him. Then he made him overseer of his house, and all that he had he put under his authority. 5 So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had in the house and in the field. 6 Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate.

Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
