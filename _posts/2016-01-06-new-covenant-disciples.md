<ul>
	<li>Matthew Mark Luke and John, Word Disciples (Singular and Plural ) used 200 times</li>
	<li>Book of John 10 Times</li>
	<li>Book of Acts 30 Times</li>
	<li>After Acts there was no mention of the word "Disciple" , because we became the sons and daughters of God</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> New Covenant Only starts after the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Which means we can't say Mathew, Mark, Luke, John and Acts are full of New Covenant, as it hasn't been established until the end of those most chapters. And those books are mainly written for Jewish people, but of course we can learn from it.
<h2><strong>Last time Disciple is used as "Old Disciple"</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Acts 21:16
</span><span class="passage-display-version">King James Version (KJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-KJV-27681" class="text Acts-21-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>old disciple</strong></span>, with whom we should lodge.</span>
<h2><strong>Once Father comes, we are no more disciples</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Family of God</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>In other words now we are in the Family of God</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">John 20:17
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-26885" class="text John-20-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">“Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and <i>to</i> My God and your God.’”</span></span>
<ul>
	<li>we are not disciples like the Jewish people</li>
	<li>There is a demarcation very clear that now we are the sons and daughters of God</li>
</ul>
Now we are called,

Son of God or Servant of God ( Servant : Duolos in Greek  http://biblehub.com/greek/1401.htm )
<ul>
	<li>Only a Son can be a Glorious Servant</li>
	<li>Glory when the son becomes a servant</li>
	<li>A servant trying to be servant, there is no glory</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">John 17:6
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<strong><span id="en-NKJV-26766" class="text John-17-6">Jesus Prays for His Disciples</span></strong>

<span class="text John-17-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup><span class="woj">“I have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.</span></span>

<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Romans 8:15
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-28132" class="text Rom-8-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.”</span>
<ul>
	<li>Once Father comes, we are no more disciples</li>
	<li>We are people that keep on learning for the rest of our lives</li>
	<li>We will always be the followers of Jesus</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Already we satisfied of being a Disciple</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>To carry the cross and to Follow Jesus</li>
	<li>Jewish tradition is that, those who carry cross are on the way to death</li>
	<li>Bible clearly says that "We are crucified with Christ", we died with Christ and we are raised with Christ, which means, we have already carried the cross, died and raise.
<ul>
	<li>That's how we became a New Creation, the same moment when we Believed on Christ Jesus ( at the moment when we got saved )</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Don't go back to Old Covenant again
