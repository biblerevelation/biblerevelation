<strong>Psalm 68:1-2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Glory of God in His Goodness to Israel</strong>
<strong> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. A Song.</strong>

68 Let God arise,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Let His enemies be scattered</strong></span>;
Let those also who hate Him <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>flee</strong> </span>before Him.
2 As smoke is <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>driven</strong> </span>away,
So <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>drive</strong> </span>them away;
As wax <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>melts</strong> </span>before the fire,
So let the wicked <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>perish</strong> </span>at the presence of God.
