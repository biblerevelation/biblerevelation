<h2 dir="ltr">Are you Preaching 10 Commandments?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">"You are doing Ministry of Death as per Bible"</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ministry of Death is also called Ministry of Condemnation</li>
	<li>Very Obvious, Ministry of death brings death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">2 Corinthians 3:6-9</h3>
<p dir="ltr">New International Version (NIV)</p>
<p dir="ltr">6 He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenantâ€”not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #b945b7;"><strong>letter kills</strong></span>, but the Spirit gives life.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">The Greater Glory of the New Covenant</h3>
<h2 dir="ltr">Ministry of Death:</h2>
<p dir="ltr">7 Now if the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #b945b7; text-decoration: underline;">ministry that brought death</span></strong></span>, which was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>engraved in letters on stone</strong></span>, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was,</p>

<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Ministry of Spirit:</span></h2>
8 will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
<h2>Ministry of Spirit much more Glorious than Ministry of Death</h2>
9 If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!
<ul>
	<li>Ministry of Death is the Old Covenant</li>
	<li>Ministry of Death is the Ministry which brings death</li>
	<li>Ministry of Spirit is the New Covenant</li>
	<li>Ministry of Spirit is the Ministry which brings Righteousness</li>
	<li>10 Commandments is also called LAW</li>
</ul>
<h2>What does Commandments / Law say?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Do Good --&gt; Get Good</li>
	<li>Do Bad --&gt; Get Bad</li>
	<li>Do Good --&gt; God bless you</li>
	<li>Do Bad --&gt; Curse comes over you</li>
</ul>
This is called ministry of death.
