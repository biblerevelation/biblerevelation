<h2>Abraham's Blessing</h2>
<strong>Genesis 22:15-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,

16 and said: “By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son—

17 <strong>blessing I will bless you</strong>, and multiplying <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven</span></strong> and <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>as the sand which is on the seashore</strong></span>; and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies</strong></span>.

18 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed</strong></span>, because you have obeyed My voice.”
