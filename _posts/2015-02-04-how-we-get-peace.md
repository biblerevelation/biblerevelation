<strong>John 20:19-20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Apostles Commissioned</strong>

19 Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“Peace be with you.” 20 When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side.</strong></span> Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
<ul>
	<li>Jesus showed His hands and His side</li>
	<li>Justification gives us Peace</li>
</ul>
