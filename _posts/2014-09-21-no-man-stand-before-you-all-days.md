<strong>Joshua 1:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life</strong></span>; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>NO MAN</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ALL THE DAYS</strong></span></li>
</ul>
