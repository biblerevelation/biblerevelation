<strong>Proverbs 25:21-22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 If your enemy is hungry, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>give him bread to eat</strong></span>;
And if he is thirsty, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>give him water to drink</strong></span>;
22 For so you will heap coals of fire on his head,
And <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the Lord will reward you</strong></span>.
