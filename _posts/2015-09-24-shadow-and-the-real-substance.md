<h2>Law is the shadow of the Good things</h2>
Law is the shadow of the Good things to come

<strong>Hebrews 10:1-2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Animal Sacrifices Insufficient</strong>
<p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Heb-10-1"><span class="chapternum">10 </span>For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, <i>and</i> not the very image of the things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect. </span><span id="en-NKJV-30136" class="text Heb-10-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</span></p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Keeping food in the table and telling the other person to eat the shadow.</li>
	<li>Kissing the loved ones on their photograph.</li>
</ul>
10 Commandments are shadows
<h2>Jesus is the substance</h2>
<strong>Hebrews 10:11-12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Christ’s Death Perfects the Sanctified</strong>

<span class="text Heb-10-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. </span><span id="en-NKJV-30146" class="text Heb-10-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,</span>
<h3>COVERED VS REMOVED</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Bible use the word covering ( Atonement )</li>
</ul>
<h4>Atonement example</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A spot in the shirt and we are trying to hide it with a jacket</li>
</ul>
<h4>Old Covenant</h4>
<ul>
	<li>In the Old Testament their sins were COVERED using the blood of Bulls and Goats</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Covenant</h4>
<ul>
	<li>But the Blood of Jesus Christ has REMOVED our sins</li>
</ul>
