<strong>Proverbs 4:20-22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 My son, give attention to my words;
Incline <strong>your</strong> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ear</strong></span> to my sayings.
21 Do not let them depart from <strong>your</strong> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>eyes</strong></span>;
Keep them in the midst of <strong>your</strong> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>heart</strong></span>;
22 For they are life to those who find them,
And health to all their flesh.
<ul>
	<li>Ear : Hear Gods word</li>
	<li>Eyes : See Gods word in Action. See/Imagine yourself beingÂ blessed and prosperous</li>
	<li>Heart : Get Gods word inside your heart</li>
</ul>
