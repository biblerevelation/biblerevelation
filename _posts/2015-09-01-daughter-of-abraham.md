<h2>Define Daughter of Abraham</h2>
Those who believe in Jesus are called Daughter of Abraham or Son of Abraham
<h3><strong>Galatians 3:29</strong></h3>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-29132" class="text Gal-3-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>And if you <i>are</i> Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span>
<h2>Ought not you be free</h2>
<h3>Luke 13:16-17</h3>
New King James Version (NKJV)

16 So ought not this woman, being a <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">daughter of Abraham</span></strong>, whom Satan has bound—think of it—for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?” 17 And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.
<h3>Being Daughter of Abraham</h3>
Ought not you be free from your bodange
<h3>Being Son of Abraham</h3>
Ought not you be free from your bodange
