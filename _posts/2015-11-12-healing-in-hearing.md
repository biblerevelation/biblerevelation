<h2><strong>Paul at Listra</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>When the lay man in Listra was hearing when Paul Preached ( Paul in a loud voice : "Stand Up" ) , He got healed completely and no longer a Criple</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Acts 14:8-10
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span class="text Acts-14-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had never walked. </span><span id="en-NKJV-27424" class="text Acts-14-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup><i>This</i> man <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>heard</strong> </span>Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed, </span><span id="en-NKJV-27425" class="text Acts-14-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>said with a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” And he leaped and walked.</span>
<h2><strong>Peter at Cornelius House</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>In Cornelius House, when Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Acts 10:44
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span class="text Acts-10-44"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>heard</strong> </span>the word.</span>
<h2><strong>Jesus Cleansing a Leper</strong></h2>
<p class="passage-display"><strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Matthew 8:1-4
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong></p>
<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Matt-8-1"><span class="chapternum">8 </span>When He had come down from the mountain, <strong>great multitudes followed Him</strong>. </span><span id="en-NKJV-23348" class="text Matt-8-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”</span></p>
<span id="en-NKJV-23349" class="text Matt-8-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then Jesus put out <i>His</i> hand and touched him, saying, <span class="woj">“I am willing; be cleansed.”</span>Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23350" class="text Matt-8-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">“See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</span></span>
<h3><strong>Leper CAME to Jesus</strong></h3>
SOME THING MADE HIM TO COME
<ul>
	<li>great multitudes followed Him  : means Jesus is walking in the opposite direction</li>
	<li>Previous chapter Jesus was Preaching in the Mountain to the People, so He had to come down</li>
	<li>The Mountain has good sound acoustics, so the sound even reaches people who stand way down</li>
	<li>THATS HOW, the Leper would have <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>heard</strong></span> what Jesus was Preaching, that's how he <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>came</strong></span> to Jesus with boldness ( Legally as per Law, a Leper is not allowed to come near anyone, if so, the Leper will be stoned to death ), so obviously the Leper heard what Jesus Preached which is not of the Law</li>
</ul>
