<h3>Isaiah 58:13-14</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>

13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and <strong><span style="color: #000080;">call the sabbath a delight</span></strong>, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:

14 Then shalt <strong>thou delight thyself in the Lord</strong>; and <strong>I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth</strong>, and <strong>feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father</strong>: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
<h2>On Sabbath Day</h2>
<ul>
	<li>not doing thine own ways,</li>

<h2>Old Testament Commandment</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Leviticus 25:1-4</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>

25 And the Lord spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord.

3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
<h2>Commanded Blessing</h2>
<div>
<h3>Leviticus 25:20-22</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>

20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

21 Then I will <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #934db1;"><strong>command my blessing upon you</strong></span> in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
