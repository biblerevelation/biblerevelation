<h3>Mark 16:17-18</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they shall speak with new tongues</span>;

18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</blockquote>
<h3>Only After this part “they shall speak with new tongues”, it is followed by</h3>
<ul>
	<li>They shall take up serpents; and</li>
	<li>if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;</li>
	<li>they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</li>
</ul>
<h2>It clearly shows that the more you speak in Tongues, more you become Supernatural</h2>
