<h2><strong>Rejecting the Pillar of Cloud / Fire</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">John 8:56-59
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-26438" class="text John-8-56"><sup class="versenum">56 </sup><span class="woj">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw <i>it</i> and was glad.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26440" class="text John-8-58"><sup class="versenum">58 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">“Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26441" class="text John-8-59"><sup class="versenum">59 </sup>Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Jesus hid Himself</strong></span> and went out of the temple, <strong>going through the midst of them</strong>, and so <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>passed</strong> </span>by.</span>
<h2><strong><span id="en-NKJV-26442" class="text John-9-1">A Man Born Blind Receives Sight</span></strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">John 9:1-6

<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text John-9-1"><span class="chapternum">9 </span>Now as <i>Jesus</i> <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>passed</strong> </span>by, He saw a man who was blind from birth. </span><span id="en-NKJV-26443" class="text John-9-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>And His disciples asked Him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”</span></p>
<span id="en-NKJV-26444" class="text John-9-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">“Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26445" class="text John-9-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup><span class="woj">I</span><span class="woj"> must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; <i>the</i> night is coming when no one can work.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26446" class="text John-9-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup><span class="woj">As long as I am in the world, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>I am the light of the world</strong></span>.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-26447" class="text John-9-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>When He had said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.</span>
<h2><strong>Pillar of Cloud ( Pillar of Fire )</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Exodus 14:19-20

<span id="en-NKJV-1909" class="text Exod-14-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them. </span><span id="en-NKJV-1910" class="text Exod-14-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>darkness </strong></span><i><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>to the one</strong></span>,</i> and it gave light by night <i>to the other,</i> so that the one did not come near the other all that night.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Pillar of Cloud made the Egyptians blinded.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Woman brought for stoning</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">John 8:7-9
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-26389" class="text John-8-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them,<span class="woj">“He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.”</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-26390" class="text John-8-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. </span><span id="en-NKJV-26391" class="text John-8-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>Then those who heard <i>it,</i>being convicted by <i>their</i> <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>conscience</strong></span>, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest <i>even</i> to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Pharisees and Sadducee were blinded.</li>
	<li>She could have also gone, because she has found the Light of Life.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> We received "<strong><span style="color: #800080;">Conscience</span></strong>" as a result of the fall of Adam and Eve.
