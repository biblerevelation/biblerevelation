<h3>Luke 2:52</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #9846b8;"><strong>stature</strong></span>, and in favor with God and man.</blockquote>
<div>

King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<blockquote>
<div>

52 And Jesus <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>increased</strong></span> in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

</div></blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>We all know that We have to Grow in wisdom, in favor with God and man ( we have to ask God for Wisdom, favor )</li>
	<li>Profound thing is that the above verse also says "<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #9846b8;"><strong>stature</strong></span>"</li>
	<li>Shows the <strong>IMPORTANCE</strong> of Stature as well</li>
	<li>Clearly understandable that God want's us also to Grow tall physically</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Clearly says that God wants us to <strong>look good</strong>. </span></li>
	<li>Ask, and it shall be given unto you ( Matthew 7:7 ) ,  May He grant you <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>according</strong> </span>to <strong>YOUR</strong> heart’s <span style="color: #008000;"><strong><em>desire</em> </strong></span>( Psalm 20:4 NIV )</li>
</ul>
