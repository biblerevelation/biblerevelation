<h2>Your tongue is your rudder</h2>
<strong>James 3:4</strong>
<strong> The Message (MSG)</strong>

3-5 A bit in the mouth of a horse controls the whole horse. A small rudder on a huge ship in the hands of a skilled captain sets a course in the face of the strongest winds. A word out of your mouth may seem of no account, but it can accomplish nearly anything—or destroy it!

<strong>James 3:4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires.
