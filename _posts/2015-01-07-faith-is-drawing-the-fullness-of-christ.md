<h2>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralytic</h2>
<strong>Luke 5:17-26</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 Now it happened on a certain day, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>as He was teaching</strong></span>, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>And the power of the Lord was present to heal <span style="color: #ff00ff;">them</span></strong></span>. 18 Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him. 19 And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with his bed through the tiling into the midst before Jesus.

20 When He saw their faith, He said to him, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.”

21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Who can forgive sins but God alone?</strong></span>”

22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, He answered and said to them, “Why are you reasoning in your hearts? 23 <strong><span style="color: #33cccc;">Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise up and walk’?</span></strong> 24 But that you may know that the <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Son of Man</strong></span> has <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>power <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on earth</span> to forgive sins</strong></span>”—He said to the man who was paralyzed, “I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”

25 Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today!”

	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">as He was teaching</span> : </strong>active indicative tense in Greek. While was continually preaching</li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">And the power of the Lord was present to heal</span> <span style="color: #ff00ff;">them :</span></strong> the power of the Lord is in <strong>active indicative tense in Greek, </strong>actively the power of the Lord was delivered to ALL of them to heal them</li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #008080;">"Who can forgive sins but God alone?" :</span> </strong>Pharisees trying to keep God in heaven and people apart, that Pharisees could be in-between them and increase their own requirements/value</li>
	<li><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>power <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on earth</span> to forgive sins : </strong></span>When Jesus told power on earth, it was contradiction to Pharisees as they thought God can only be in heaven and heal from heaven.</li>
	<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Son of Man : </strong></span>Jesus became Son of Man to make us the sons of God</li>
	<li><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise up and walk’?</strong></span></li>

<h2>His Fullness</h2>
<h3>The Word Becomes Flesh</h3>
<strong>John 1:14-16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>we beheld His glory</strong></span>, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">full</span> of grace and truth</strong>.

15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.’”

16 And <strong>of His <span style="color: #0000ff;">fullness</span> we have all received, and grace for grace</strong>.
<h3>Drawing His fullness</h3>

	<li>Drawing His fullness on to our emptiness is faith.</li>
