<strong>Hebrews 8:9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

9 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>not according to the covenant</strong></span> that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
<ul>
	<li>We can not worship God in the spirit of the Old Covenant</li>
	<li>We can worship the Father with the Spirit of Sonship</li>
	<li>Worship is all about the father ( When Jesus met the lady near the well )</li>
	<li>New covenant is all about Grace</li>
</ul>
<strong>2 Peter 3:18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

18 but <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ</strong></span>.
To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.
<ul>
	<li>We get together in Bible study, to grow in theÂ Grace as our first priority</li>
	<li>Knowledge of our Lord and Savor Jesus Christ is second</li>
</ul>
