<strong>Romans 7:24-25</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 O wretched man that I am! <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Who</strong></span> will deliver me from this body of death? 25 I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!

So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
<ul>
	<li>It says "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>WHO</strong></span>", a person ( Jesus can deliver you )</li>
	<li>It doesn't say "WHAT", ( e.g.: what things should i do to deliver myself. )</li>
	<li>Things you do (doing good, helping..etc ) doesn't deliver you.</li>
	<li>Jesus only can deliver you</li>
</ul>
Once Jesus deliver you, the end Result will be that you will start doing good only, helping..etc from heart.
