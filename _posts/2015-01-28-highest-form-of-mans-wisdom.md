<h2>Old Testament Wisdom</h2>
Old Testament Wisdom by Solomon is the highest form of wisdom a normal person could achieve

<strong>Ecclesiastes 5:2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

2 Do not be rash with your mouth,
And let not your heart utter anything hastily before God.
For <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>God is in heaven, and you on earth</strong></span>;
Therefore let your words be few.
<ul>
	<li>God is in heaven</li>
	<li>We on earth</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Testament Wisdom</h2>
But now,
<ul>
	<li>We are seated with Christ</li>
	<li>We are not normalÂ person</li>
	<li>We have received Supernatural Wisdom</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Christ is our Wisdom</blockquote>
