<strong>Proverbs 24:11-12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Deliver those who are drawn toward death</strong></span>,
And hold back those stumbling to the slaughter.
12 If you say, “Surely we did not know this,”
Does not He who weighs the hearts consider it?
He who keeps your soul, does He not know it?
And will He not render to each man according to his deeds?
