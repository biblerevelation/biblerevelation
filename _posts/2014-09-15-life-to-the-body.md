<strong>Proverbs 14:29-30</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

29 He who is slow to wrath has great understanding,
But he who is impulsive exalts folly.

30 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>A sound heart is life to the body</strong></span>,
But envy is rottenness to the bones.
