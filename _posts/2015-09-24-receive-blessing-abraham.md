<h2>Fullness blessing</h2>
&nbsp;

<strong>Romans 4:13-15</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Promise Granted Through Faith</strong>

<span class="text Rom-4-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>For the promise that he would be the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>heir of the world</strong></span> <i>was</i> not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>righteousness of faith</strong></span>. </span><span id="en-NKJV-28037" class="text Rom-4-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>For if those who are of the law <i>are</i> heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, </span><span id="en-NKJV-28038" class="text Rom-4-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law <i>there is</i> no transgression.</span>
<ul>
	<li>To become the heir of the world you need to become wealthy</li>
	<li>To become the heir of the world you need to become healthy</li>
	<li>To become the heir of the world you need to become prosperous</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The greater promise includes the lesser</blockquote>
<h2>Law brings wrath</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The more we are conscious of wrath, The more we experience difficulty</li>
	<li>The more we are conscious of health, the more we experience health</li>
	<li>The more we are conscious of wealth, the more we experience wealth</li>
	<li>The more we are conscious of provision, the more we experience provision</li>
	<li>The more we are conscious of favour, the more we experience favour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Righteousness of Faith</h2>
Righteousness of Faith is a Gift
