<h2>Note:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Righteousness is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gift</strong></span></li>
	<li>Righteousness is NOT a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reward</strong></span></li>
	<li>There is NOTHING for you to do to get righteousness.</li>
	<li>Jesus Christ is the Gift of Righteousness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Difference between Reward and Gift</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reward</span>:</strong> You DO something to get the reward : You earn it</li>
	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gift</span>:</strong> You get it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">freely</span>, You DON'T need to DO anything</li>
</ul>
<h2>How you get Righteousness?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>to receive the Gift of Righteousness: It DIDN'T say you to be good or you to do good or you to confess your sins or you to don't sin</li>
	<li>It says <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #9a3bc3;"><strong>Believe</strong></span> in Christ Jesus and Receive the Gift of Righteousness, which leeds you to Everlasting Life.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.</li>
