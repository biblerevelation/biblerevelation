<blockquote>"Himself" is warm</blockquote>
<h2><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</strong></h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 For <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the Lord Himself</strong></span> will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>we shall always be with the Lord</strong></span>.
<h2><strong>Matthew 8:17</strong></h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:

“<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>He Himself</strong></span> took our infirmities
And bore our sicknesses.”
<h2><strong>Luke 24:15</strong></h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Jesus Himself</strong></span> drew near and went with them.
<h2><strong>Luke 24:27</strong></h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

27 And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Himself</strong></span>.
<h2><strong>Galatians 2:20</strong></h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Himself</strong> </span>for me.
<h2><strong>Ephesians 5:2</strong></h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

2 And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Himself</strong> </span>for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.
