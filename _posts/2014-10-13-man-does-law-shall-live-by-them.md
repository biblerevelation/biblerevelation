<strong>Galatians 3:5-14</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 Therefore <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you</strong></span>, does He do it by the works of the law, or <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>by</strong> <strong>the hearing of faith</strong></span>?— 6 just as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” 7 Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, “In you all the nations shall be blessed.” 9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.
<h2><strong>The Law Brings a Curse</strong></h2>
10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.” 11 But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith.” 12 Yet <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>the law is not of faith</strong></span>, but “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the man who does them shall live by them</strong></span>.”

13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”), 14 that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
