<strong>Proverbs 24:15-16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
Do not plunder his resting place;
16 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>For a righteous man may fall seven times</strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> And rise again</strong></span>,
But the wicked shall fall by calamity.
