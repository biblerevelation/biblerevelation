<h3>Are we in search of wisdom? Or Wisdom is in search of us?</h3>
<strong>Proverbs 1:20-25</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h2>The Call of Wisdom</h2>
20 Wisdom <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>calls</strong></span> aloud outside;
She raises her voice in the open squares.
21 She <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cries out</span></strong></span> in the chief concourses,
At the openings of the gates in the city
She speaks her words:
22 “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
For scorners delight in their scorning,
And fools hate knowledge.
23 Turn at <strong>my rebuke</strong>;
Surely I will pour out my spirit on you;
I will make my words known to you.
24 Because <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">called</span></strong></span> and you refused,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I have stretched out my hand</strong></span> and no one regarded,
25 Because you disdained all my counsel,
And would have none of my rebuke,

<strong>Proverbs 1:29-30</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

29 Because they hated knowledge
And did not choose the fear of the Lord,
30 They would have none of my counsel
And despised <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>my every rebuke</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 8:1-3</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 Does not wisdom <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>cry out</strong></span>,
And understanding <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>lift up her voice</strong></span>?
2 She takes her stand on the top of the high hill,
Beside the way, where the paths meet.
3 She <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>cries out</strong></span> by the gates, at the entry of the city,
At the entrance of the doors:

<strong>Proverbs 9:1-6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h2>The Way of Wisdom</h2>
9 Wisdom has built her house,
She has hewn out her seven pillars;
2 She has slaughtered her meat,
She has mixed her wine,
She has also furnished her table.
3 She has sent out her maidens,
She <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>cries out</strong></span> from the highest places of the city,
4 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
As for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,
5 “Come, eat of my bread
And drink of the wine I have mixed.
6 Forsake foolishness and live,
And go in the way of understanding.
