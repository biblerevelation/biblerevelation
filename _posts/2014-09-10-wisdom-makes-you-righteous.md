<strong>Proverbs 10:23-24</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

23 To do evil is like sport to a fool,
But a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>man of understanding</strong></span> has wisdom.
24 The <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>fear of the wicked will come upon him</strong></span>,
And the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>desire of the righteous will be granted</strong></span>.
