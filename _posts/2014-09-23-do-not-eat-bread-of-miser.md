<strong>Proverbs 23:6-8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not eat the bread of a miser</strong></span>,
Nor desire his delicacies;
7 For as he thinks in his heart, so is he.
“Eat and drink!” he says to you,
But his heart is not with you.
8 The morsel you have eaten, you will vomit up,
And waste your pleasant words.
