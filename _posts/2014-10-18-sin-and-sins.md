<strong>Romans 8:3-4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>sin</strong></span> in the flesh,

4 that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
<ul>
	<li>He condemned <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>sin</strong></span>Â --&gt; Singular</li>
	<li>sin in the flesh produces sins</li>
	<li>sins --&gt; Actions</li>
	<li>sins are forgiven</li>
	<li>sin condemned</li>
	<li>What God condemn cease to exists in His eyes.</li>
</ul>
