<strong>Proverbs 15:16-17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord</strong></span>,
Than great treasure with trouble.
17 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Better is</strong></span> a dinner of herbs <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>where love is</strong></span>,
Than a fatted calf with hatred.

<strong>Proverbs 16:8</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Better is a little with righteousness</strong></span>,
Than vast revenues without justice.
