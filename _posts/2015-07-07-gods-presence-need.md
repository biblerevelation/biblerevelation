<h2>Presence of Jesus</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Presence is what makes us a success</li>
	<li>We don't need to be eloquent, we just need the Presence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When you pray for a person, stop for a while</li>
	<li>Worship the Lord, say few words and Know His Presence</li>
	<li>When you are by a sick person, When His presence is sensed, faith is released,</li>
	<li>you don't even need to ask, the sick person will be healed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feel His Presence</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus told that He will never leave us or forsake us.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sense His presence anywhere</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We can sense His presence where we are because there is no distance in the spirit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solomon Story</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Solomon went to the Mount Gibeon, where Tabernacle of Moses was located</li>
	<li>There was no Presence of God, because the arc of covenant was not there</li>
	<li>Arc: Symbol of Gods Presence</li>
	<li>Solomon gave 1000 burnt offering</li>
	<li>On that night Solomon received wisdom</li>
	<li>First sign of receiving wisdom, Solomon straight went to Zion and he worshiped before the arc</li>
	<li>Solomon became to cherish the Presence</li>
</ul>
