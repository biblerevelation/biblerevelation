<h2>Forgiveness of sins</h2>
<strong>Ephesians 1:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace</span></strong>
<ul>
	<li>the forgiveness of sins, NOT according to our goodness</li>
	<li>the forgiveness of sins, NOT according to our Obedience</li>
	<li>the forgiveness of sins, NOT according to our Faithfulness</li>
	<li>the forgiveness of sins, NOT according to our self control</li>
	<li>the forgiveness of sins, NOT according to our non sinning character</li>
</ul>
<strong>John 1:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>came</strong> </span>through Jesus Christ.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>came</strong></span> : singular in Greek language</li>
	<li>Grace and Truth are not different, they are the same</li>
	<li>Singular : Single Person : Jesus Christ : Grace and Truth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dominion over sin</h2>
<h3><strong>Only way that sin cannot be dominion over us</strong></h3>
<strong>Romans 6:14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 For <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sin</strong> </span>shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">sin</span> </strong>is NOT a <em>verb</em></li>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sin</strong> </span>is a <em>noun</em></li>
</ul>
Law says, do good --&gt; get good : do bad --&gt; get bad
<h2>Story of Israelites coming out from Egypt</h2>
<h3>Before 10 Commandments was given</h3>
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>BASED ON GOD'S FAITHFULNESS </strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>Murmuring or complaining is a sin.</li>
	<li>Israelites murmured before the 10 commandments were give
<ul>
	<li>NO ONE DIED</li>
	<li>Because of His Unmerited favour</li>
	<li>Because God is faithful and because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>They came out because of God's faithfulness</li>
	<li>They murmured before Red sea, Waters of Mara, for the Lack of food.
<ul>
	<li>No one died</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Because of God's faithfulness, Read sea opened, waters of Mara became sweet after putting the tree inside ( tree represents cross ), Lack of food was satisfied by manna from Heaven</li>
	<li>Even after they murmured,
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>God was with them</strong></span> during the day time as cloud, night time as fire. And also they were provided with water after Moses hit the rock</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED BEFORE GIVING THE 10 COMMANDMENTS</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>After 10 Commandments was given</h3>
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">BASED ON PEOPLE'S FAITHFULNESS </span></strong>
<ul>
	<li>Israelites murmured after giving 10 Commandments
<ul>
	<li>They were dead each time they murmured</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Ten commandments was given in Exodus 20</li>
	<li>On Exodus 19, Israelites were boasting on their Self Righteousness, as if all blessings were because of their own faithfulness,
<ul>
	<li>So 10 Commandments was given</li>
	<li>God immediately said to Moses, <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>let the people of Israelites not come near Me</strong></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>After Jesus Died on the Cross</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus has redeemed us from the 10 Commandments / Law</li>
	<li>We started living "Before 10 commandments was given" life</li>
	<li>Now <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>BASED ON HIS FAITHFULNESS</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Story of women found in Adultery</h2>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<ul>
	<li>"Neither do I condemn you, go and sin no more " - Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>No condemnation was given first, that leads to sin no more.</li>
	<li>Some churches have in reverse like : go and sin no more then we won't condemn you</li>
</ul>
<h3>Story</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When the women was caught in adultery, she was brought to Jesus to find fault with Jesus</li>
	<li>Pharisees and Sadducee were telling the law of Moses to Jesus, as if such and such women should be stoned</li>
	<li>Jesus knelt down and wrote on the ground with His own fingers
<ul>
	<li>This instance happened inside the temple.</li>
	<li>It was  a stony ground</li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Jesus was trying to explain the fact</strong></span> (depicting) that, He is the one who wrote the 10 commandments in Mount Sinai and gave it to Moses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Jesus was keeping the law of Moses by saying if any of you were righteous, let him stone her first. One by one left</li>
	<li>On the other side, Jesus could stone the women, but He didn't.</li>
	<li>Jesus demonstrated HIS Love and HIS faithfulness.</li>
</ul>
At that time, Jesus was the One who is going to receive the sin of the women on His body on the cross
<h2>Story of The Prodigal son</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jews tradition is to divide the inheritance only after fathers death, but the son was least bothered about that, considering that His father was dead ( Prodigal son has No love towards his father ), hence he asked for dividing his inheritance.</li>
	<li>The son returned to the house, not because He understood the love of his Father, but because he is hungry</li>
	<li>He is trying to prove His self righteousness by stating that he would like to be His servant rather than accepting His Father's love and being His son</li>
	<li>According the Jewish Law, the son has to be stoned for this sin. So for protecting him, his Father ran towards him</li>
	<li>Even at the end, the son didn't understand Father's love, but the Father only ran towards him, hug him, kiss him, even after he would have smelled like a pig/swine. Shows the love of the Father in heaven.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Source of Good works</h2>
<strong>Romans 11:6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.
<h3><strong>Ephesians 2:8-10</strong></h3>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>For by grace you have been</strong> </span><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>saved</strong> </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>through faith</strong></span>, and that <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>not of yourselves</strong></span>; it is the gift of God,
9 <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>not of works</strong></span>, lest anyone should boast.
10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>good works</strong></span>, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
<h4><strong>Reverse Engineering Ephesians 2:8-10 </strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Example:</strong> Following the river backwards to find it's source</li>
	<li>Good works &lt;-- not of works &lt;-- not of yourselves &lt;-- For by grace you have been saved through faith</li>
</ul>
<h4>Word "<span style="color: #ff00ff;">saved</span>" in Greek</h4>
<ul>
	<li>http://biblehub.com/greek/4982.htm</li>
	<li>Saved, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>healed</strong></span>, protected</li>
	<li>Also used in "The healing of the women with an issue of blood"</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mark 5:34</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

34 And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>healed</strong> </span>of your affliction.”
<h3>Importance of Undeserved and Unmerited favour of God</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Paul said "Grace be with you all" whenever he starts and finishes a book/letter. Shows the importance.</li>
	<li>The word "Grace" was used by Paul to the most immoral church Corinthians and more un-scriptural church Galatians, 26 time altogether.</li>
</ul>
<h2>There is no condemnation</h2>
<strong>Romans 8:1</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 There is therefore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>now</strong></span></span> <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>no condemnation</strong> </span>to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
<h3>Don't beat yourself</h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DON'T SAY</strong></span> "I should not have done that"</li>
</ul>
<strong>If you beat yourself, it's a matter of time you will beat others : with words, actions</strong>
<ul>
	<li>if you are hard on yourself, you will hard with others</li>
	<li>if you don't forgive yourself, you won't have mind to forgive others</li>
	<li>if you beat yourself, you will beat others</li>
	<li>if you hurt yourself, you will hurt others</li>
</ul>
<strong>If you stop beating yourself, you set yourself free, and You are free to forgive others</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Stop beating yourself, Jesus took all you beatings at the cross</li>
	<li>Stop hurting yourself, Jesus was hurt for all your sins</li>
	<li>Stop blaming yourself, Jesus took all punishments for your mistakes</li>
</ul>
<strong>By doing this you are honouring Jesus and for what He has done for you</strong><strong>.</strong>
