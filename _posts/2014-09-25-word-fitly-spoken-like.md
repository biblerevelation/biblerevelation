Proverbs 25:11-12
New King James Version (NKJV)

11 A word fitly spoken is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>like apples of gold</strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> In settings of silver</strong></span>.
12 Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold
Is a wise rebuker to an obedient ear.
