<h2>Peace with all people and Holiness</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The grace of God is the root to pursue Peace with all people and Holiness</li>
	<li>This verse is about seeing the Lord, but not about going to heaven</li>
	<li>If you want to see the Lord:
<ul>
	<li>don't fall short from of the grace of God, --&gt; that leads to peace with all people ( opposite of bitterness with all people ) and holiness, --&gt; that leads to seeing the Lord</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Falling short from the grace of God --&gt; leads to bitterness, leads to sin</li>

<strong>Hebrews 12:14-29</strong>

<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord<strong>:</strong> 15 <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>looking</strong> </span>carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled; 16 lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. 17 For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">he found no place for repentance</span></strong>, though he sought it diligently with tears.
<h3>Mount Sinai</h3>
<strong>The Glorious Company</strong>

18 For <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>you have not come to the mountain</strong></span> that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest, 19 and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. 20 (For they could not endure what was commanded: “And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot with an arrow.” 21 And so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, <span style="color: #808080;">“I am exceedingly afraid and trembling.”</span>)
<h3>Mount Zion</h3>
22 But <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>you have come to</strong> <strong>Mount Zion</strong></span> and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, 23 to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, 24 to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Jesus</strong> </span>the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.

<strong>Hear the Heavenly Voice</strong>

25 See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him who speaks from heaven, 26 whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also heaven.” 27 Now this, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.

28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. 29 For our God is a consuming fire.
<h3>Opposite to Peace and Holiness</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Peace opposite : bitterness</li>
	<li>Holiness opposite : example like fornication</li>
</ul>
<h2>Holiness, without which no one will see the Lord</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">holiness, without which no one will see the Lord:</span></strong>
<ul>
	<li>he is talking about revelation</li>
	<li>he is talking not talking about going to heaven</li>
	<li>he is talking to the Jews</li>
	<li>see in it's context
<ul>
	<li>the verse ends with colon(:), which means the verse is continuing on to next</li>
	<li>so read all together to understand its meaning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Following verse comes to say that there is a relation between holiness and Grace of God.
<ul>
	<li>Holiness and Grace of God are directly proportional and same</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>He doesn't understand sonship</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spirit of the Younger brother ( New Covenant )</h2>

	<li>Spirit of Son-ship</li>
</ul>
<h2>Words of people with bitterness</h2>
<blockquote>Words of people with bitterness creates wounds in the innermost body</blockquote>
<strong>Proverbs 18:8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 The <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>words of a talebearer</strong></span> are like tasty trifles,
And <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>they go down into the inmost body</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 18:8</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

8 The words of a talebearer are as <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>wounds</strong></span>, and they go down into the <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>innermost parts of the belly</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>it will cut inside</li>
	<li>it will create wounds inside</li>
	<li>belly is the place where many things starts</li>
	<li>"<span style="color: #800080;"><strong>out of your belly shall flow the rivers of living water</strong></span>"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Living water</h3>
<strong>John 7:38</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water</strong></span>.

<strong>John 4:10-14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 Jesus answered and said to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>living water</strong></span>.”

11 The woman said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>living water</strong></span>? 12 Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?”

13 Jesus answered and said to her, “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.”
<h3>Living water in regards to Jews</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If a Jew touches another defiled person, they themselves become Defiled.</li>
	<li>Jews, when they were defiled, to remove their defilement, they come to a place where they take bath.</li>
	<li>In that place, to make the water new, they will pour newly stored water on to the remaining water to make the water pure, so that the defilement can be removed. That stored water is called living water.</li>
	<li>So living water for Jews means, it will cleanses them from defilement. A person without defilement will receive blessings from God</li>
	<li>Imagine, living water which which comes from inside, would make many people clean.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Peace with people and holiness</h2>
<ul>
	<li>What produces peace with people?</li>
	<li>What produces holiness?</li>
	<li>by which you produce fresh revelation, it is always in the Grace of God</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Long before any sin, they fall from Grace, which leads to bitterness and then sin.</blockquote>
