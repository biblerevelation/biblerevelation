<strong>Proverbs 14:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 There is a way that seems right to a man,
But <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>its end is the way of death</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 14:14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 The <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways</strong></span>, But a good man will be satisfied from above.

<strong>Proverbs 16:1-3</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

1 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>The</strong> <strong>preparations of the heart belong to man</strong></span>,
But the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.

2 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes</strong></span>,
But the Lord weighs the spirits.

3 Commit <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>your works</strong></span> to the Lord,
And your thoughts will be established.

<strong>Proverbs 19:21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 There are <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>many plans in a man’s heart</strong></span>,
Nevertheless the Lord’s counsel—that will stand.

<strong>Proverbs 21:2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

2 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes</strong></span>,
But the Lord weighs the hearts.
<h2>Good man will be satisfied from above</h2>
