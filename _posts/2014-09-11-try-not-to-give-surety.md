<strong>Proverbs 6:1-5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

1 My son, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>if you become surety for your friend</strong></span>,
If you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,
2 You are snared by the words of your mouth;
You are taken by the words of your mouth.
3 So do this, my son, and deliver yourself;
For you have come into the hand of your friend:
Go and humble yourself;
Plead with your friend.
4 Give no sleep to your eyes,
Nor slumber to your eyelids.
5 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.

<strong>Proverbs 11:15</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 He who is surety for a stranger will suffer,
But <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>one who hates being surety is secure</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 20:16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 Take the garment of one who is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>surety for a stranger</strong></span>,
And hold it as a pledge when it is for a seductress.

<strong>Proverbs 27:13</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 Take the garment of him who is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>surety for a stranger</strong></span>,
And hold it in pledge when he is surety for a seductress.
