<strong>Proverbs 25:20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 Like one who takes away a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>garment in cold weather,</strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> And like vinegar on soda</strong></span>,
Is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
