<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 For <strong>the weapons of our warfare are not carnal</strong> but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, <strong>bringing every thought into captivity</strong> to the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>obedience of Christ</strong></span>, 6 and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.
