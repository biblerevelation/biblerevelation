<strong>Proverbs 26:7-9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 Like the legs of the lame that hang limp
Is a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>proverb in the mouth of fools</strong></span>.
8 Like one who binds a stone in a sling
Is he who gives honor to a fool.
9 Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard
Is a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>proverb in the mouth of fools</strong></span>.
