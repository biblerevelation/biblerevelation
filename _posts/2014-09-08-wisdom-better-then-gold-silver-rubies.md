<strong>Proverbs 8:10-11</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<blockquote>10 Receive my instruction, and not <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>silver</strong></span>,
And knowledge rather than choice <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>gold</strong></span>;
11 For wisdom is better than <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>rubies</strong></span>,
And all the things one may desire cannot be compared with her.</blockquote>
<strong>Proverbs 8:19</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

19 My fruit is better than <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>gold</strong></span>, yes, than fine <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>gold</strong></span>,
And my revenue than choice <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>silver</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 16:16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 How much better to get wisdom than <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>gold</strong></span>!
And to get understanding is to be chosen rather than <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>silver</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 20:15</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 There is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>gold</strong> </span>and a multitude of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>rubies</strong></span>,
But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
