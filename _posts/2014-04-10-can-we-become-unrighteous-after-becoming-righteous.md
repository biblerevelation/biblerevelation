<h3>NO. Big NO</h3>
<h3>Hebrews 9:12</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>eternal redemption</strong></span>.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Eternal means you wont loose it once you receive it</li>
	<li>Its mentioned as "Everlasting" in Amplified Version (Everlasting means Everlasting) (Hebrews 9:12)</li>
	<li>Everlasting righteousness ( Daniel 9:24 )</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Daniel 9:24</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>everlasting righteousness</strong></span>, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</blockquote>
<div class="heading passage-class-0" style="color: #5c1101;">
<h3>John 3:16</h3>
</div>
<div class="heading passage-class-0" style="color: #5c1101;">
<p class="txt-sm">New King James Version (NKJV)</p>

</div>
<blockquote><span id="en-NKJV-26137" class="text John-3-16"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">16 </span><span class="woj">For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>everlasting life</strong></span></span>.</span></span></blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>The word <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>'everlasting'</strong></span> is the Greek word '<strong>ionios</strong>'</li>
	<li>The same word 'ionios'  used of God's eternal being</li>
	<li>The same word 'ionios' used for our Redemption (our Redemption is eternal )</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>I have just sinned. How can I still be righteous?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It's NOT on what you do makes you righteous.</li>
	<li>It's NOT your obedience which make you righteous.</li>
	<li>It's on what Jesus did on the cross.</li>
	<li>It's Jesus obedience made you righteous</li>
	<li>It doesn't give you a certificate to sin</li>
	<li>More you understand the Love of Jesus seen by his forgiveness, the more you stay away from sin automatically.</li>
</ul>
