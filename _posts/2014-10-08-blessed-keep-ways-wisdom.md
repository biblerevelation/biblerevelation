<strong>Proverbs 8:32</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

32 “Now therefore, listen to me, my children,
For <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>blessed are those who keep my ways</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 8:32-36</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

32 “Now therefore, listen to me, my children,
For blessed are those who keep my ways.
33 Hear instruction and be wise,
And do not disdain it.
34 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Blessed is the man who listens to me</strong></span>,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Watching daily</strong></span> at my gates,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Waiting at the posts</strong></span> of my doors.
35 For whoever finds me finds life,
And obtains favor from the Lord;
36 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul;
All those who hate me love death.”
