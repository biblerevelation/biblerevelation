<h3>2 Corinthians 5:21</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>21 God made *Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</blockquote>
*Him represents Jesus

From the above verse,
<h2>How Jesus became sin without doing sin?</h2>
<h3><span style="color: #993366;">Similar, </span></h3>
<h2>You became the Righteousness of God in Christ without doing right deeds</h2>
Believing that we have been forgiven from our sins, past present and future: shows the love of God towards us

Knowing His goodness, leads us to repentance.
