<strong>Song of Solomon 2:14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 “O my dove, in the clefts of the rock,
In the secret places of the cliff,
Let me see your face,
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Let me hear your voice</strong></span>;
For your voice is sweet,
And your face is lovely.”

<strong>1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 Rejoice always, 17 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>pray without ceasing</strong></span>, 18 in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
