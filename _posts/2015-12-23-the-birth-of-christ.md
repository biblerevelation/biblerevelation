<h2><strong>Who can be against us?</strong></h2>

	<li>One who is Omnipotent : All Powerful</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Romans 8:31-32
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<ul>
	<li>Who can be against us?</li>
	<li>What can be against us?</li>
	<li>What is enemy against us?</li>
	<li>What is satan against us?</li>
	<li>What is diseases against us?</li>

<h2><strong>Blood</strong></h2>

	<li>Sin starts in the blood</li>
	<li>After a person dies, the first place it gets decaying is their blood
<ul>
	<li>That's why the Embalming Chemicals will be injected to a dead body in their blood stream to stop decomposition/decaying</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Bible says "The life of the flesh is in the Blood"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>That's the necessity of the Virgin Birth
<ul>
	<li>Research says Blood is not transmitted from Mother (Placenta ) to the Fetus</li>
	<li>Woman's ovum does not have the capacity to create its own blood</li>
	<li>Only after the introduction of male sperm, the fetus in itself starts developing Capillaries and Blood Streams</li>
	<li>Saying this reverently "The Holy Spirit Provided the Seed"</li>
	<li>He Conceived in the Virgin's womb, Christ.</li>
