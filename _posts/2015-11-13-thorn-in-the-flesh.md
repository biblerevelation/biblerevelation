<h2><strong>It is not a disease</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>"Thorn in the Flesh" - Paul</li>
	<li>It is a Demon Personality
<ul>
	<li>Paul sought the Lord and asked the Lord and the Lord said "My Grace is sufficient for thee"</li>
	<li>This personality is steering up troubles, but God is using this personality to bless and to open doors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
