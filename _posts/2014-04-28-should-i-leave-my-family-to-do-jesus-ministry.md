<div class="heading passage-class-0" style="color: #5c1101;">
<h3>NO. . BIG NOOO</h3>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Reason?</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>You are Trying to be Self Righteous, rather than seeking <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HIS</strong></span> Righteousness (Jesus Righteousness)</li>
	<li>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HIS</strong></span> Righteousness.</li>
	<li>Jesus already bore <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>all</strong></span> the pains for us and He fulfilled the Law already</li>
	<li>If you try to fulfill the law (<span style="color: #c0c0c0;">which you can't, that's why Jesus came for us</span>), its called Self Righteousness</li>
	<li>Rest on Jesus finished work. (<span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Jesus has finished the work of saving and redeeming us (John 19:30)</span> )</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Hebrews 4:10–11</strong></span>
<blockquote>… he who has entered His rest has <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>himself also <span style="color: #ff00ff; text-decoration: underline;">ceased</span> from his works</strong></span> as God did from His. 11 Let us therefore be diligent to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>enter that rest</strong></span>…</blockquote>
<ul style="color: #5c1101;">
	<li>"himself also ceased from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>his</strong></span> works" means stop being Self Righteous , Stop trying to fulfill the Law/works</li>
	<li>"<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>as</strong></span> God <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">did</span></strong> from His"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Luke 14</h2>
<h3>Self Righteous Group</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Its very clear that Jesus is Addressing the Multitudes</li>
	<li>Multitudes include people who think him as a magician, as a role model, believing self righteousness : because this incident is happening
<ul>
	<li>after Jesus divided the bread and fish in the mount and</li>
	<li>and when Jesus was coming out from the Chief Pharisees house being not pleased by the way they reacted</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>So Jesus was not pleased by the way multitudes approach Him (understood from the strong reply Luke 14:35b --&gt; He that hath ears to hear, let him hear)</li>
	<li>Jesus was not pleased, can also be understood by the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;"><strong>3 parables He told addressing those Self Righteous people</strong></span> (Pharisees) <strong>in Luke 14</strong></li>
	<li>These multitudes didn't consider Jesus as a savior.</li>
	<li>Jesus will be pleased if anyone consider Him as their savior</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #ff00ff;">If you are trying to be Self Righteousness, Jesus will reply to you accordingly and tell you to fulfill the Law/commandments, Which NO ONE can fulfill except Jesus.</span></h3>
<h2>Reaction after Luke 14</h2>
<h2>Luke 15</h2>
<h3>"His Righteous" Group</h3>
<ul>
	<li>After Jesus spoke Luke 14, Multitudes around Him dispersed.</li>
	<li>In Luke 15, publicans and sinners drew near Him ( because Sinners consider Him as a savior )</li>
	<li>Jesus was so pleased when people considered Him as a savior, This could be understandable because , <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;">Jesus followed up saying 3 parables for sinners</span>*</strong></span><strong> (in Luke 15)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
*sinners : People who believe on Jesus Righteousness, People who considers Jesus as a saviour and People who thinks that they are nothing without Jesus
<h3><span style="color: #ff00ff;">If you seek first the kingdom of God and "HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS (<span style="color: #808080;"><em>Jesus leaving his father, his mother, and giving His own life for us. Thus He Fulfilled the Law Luke 14:26,27, and became Righteous</em></span> )" then, </span>all these things (discipleship, Fruits of the Spirit..etc) shall be added unto you</h3>

<h3>Luke 15</h3>
<p class="txt-sm">King James Version (KJV)</p>

</div>
<div class="passage version-KJV result-text-style-normal text-html ">
<blockquote>
<p class="chapter-2"><span id="en-KJV-25590" class="text Luke-15-1"><span class="chapternum" style="font-weight: bold;">15 </span>Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.</span></p>

<h3>Luke 14:35b</h3>
<p class="txt-sm">King James Version (KJV)</p>

</div>
<div class="passage version-KJV result-text-style-normal text-html ">
<blockquote><span id="en-KJV-25589" class="text Luke-14-35">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
	<li> The word "disciple" not mentioned in New Testament after Acts Chapter</li>
	<li>The fact is, we became His sons and daughters.</li>
	<li>In New Testament Discipleship is NOT a root, its a fruit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If you consider Jesus as your savior, He will be so pleased</li>
	<li>If you boast about your self righteousness considering Him as your role model, He won't be pleased and He will reply you to accordingly and will instruct you to fulfill the Law/Commandments which NO ONE can fulfill except Jesus.</li>
	<li>But the fact is Jesus nailed all commandments on the cross for us</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="passage version-KJV result-text-style-normal text-html " style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Why don't you receive Jesus and live a stress free life rather than trying to be Self Righteous and trying to fulfill the Law/Commandments which you can't fulfill. </span></h3>

<h3>Colossians 2:14</h3>
<p class="txt-sm">King James Version (KJV)</p>

</div>
<div class="passage version-KJV result-text-style-normal text-html ">
<blockquote><span id="en-KJV-29509" class="text Col-2-14"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">14 </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blotting out the handwriting</strong></span> of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>nailing it to his cross</strong></span>;</span></blockquote>
</div>
Jesus fulfilled the Law/Commandment for us knowing that we cant fulfill. Shows the love of Jesus
<h2>Jesus fulfilled these two verse for us, Luke 14: 26-27</h2>
<h3><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Jesus Knowing that we can't fulfill the Luke 14:26-27 Law/Commandment, </span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ff00ff;">For us, Jesus left his father, mother and even He gave His own life (fulfilling Law : Proving His Righteousness )</span></h3>
&nbsp;
<blockquote><span id="en-KJV-25580" class="text Luke-14-26"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">26 </span>If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, <span style="font-weight: bold;">he cannot be my disciple</span>.</span>

<span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">27 </span>And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.</blockquote>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>Note:</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>If you don't believe on Jesus and on what He has done on the cross, then you have to fulfill the above two verse.</li>
	<li>Which means Old Testament People have to fulfill these two verse.</li>
	<li>But Glory be to God we are in the New Testament, we have Jesus.</li>
