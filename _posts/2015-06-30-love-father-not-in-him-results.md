<h2><strong>1 John 2:15-17</strong></h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love of the Father is not in him</strong></span>.

16 For all that is in the world—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life</strong></span>—is not of the Father but is of the world.

17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.
