<strong>Proverbs 8:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I love those who love me</strong></span>,
And those who seek me diligently will find me.

<strong>Proverbs 8:20-21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 I traverse the way of righteousness,
In the midst of the paths of justice,
21 That <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth</strong></span>,
That I may fill their treasuries.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Wisdom cause you to inherit wealth</strong></span>.</li>
</ul>
