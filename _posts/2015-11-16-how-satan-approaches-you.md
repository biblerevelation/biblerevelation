<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Genesis 3:1-5
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>
<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Gen-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3 </span>Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the<span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”</span></p>
<span id="en-NKJV-58" class="text Gen-3-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; </span><span id="en-NKJV-59" class="text Gen-3-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>but of the fruit of the tree which <i>is</i> in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-60" class="text Gen-3-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. <span id="en-NKJV-61" class="text Gen-3-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”</span></span>
<h2><strong>Tactics</strong></h2>
<ol>
	<li>Showing God stingy</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?</li>
	<li>There could be millions on Trees which God created, all given for Adam and Eve to eat
<ul>
	<li>One tree among those millions is so so so small.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
2. Making you think that you don't have, when you already have
<ul>
	<li>You will be like God</li>
	<li>Already Adam and Eve were made in God's image</li>
	<li>Identity Crisis</li>
	<li>Makes us to think " We need more than what we have "
<ul>
	<li>That's the problem with Galatians, Colossians</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">1 Corinthians 2:2
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-28397" class="text 1Cor-2-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.</span>
<h3><strong>How you go deeper?</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>You go deeper in the Cross</li>
	<li>You go deeper in the Person of Christ</li>
</ul>
