<p class="chapter-1"><span class="text Zech-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4 </span>Now the angel who talked with me came back and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-22925" class="text Zech-4-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>And he said to me, “What do you see?”</span></p>
<span class="text Zech-4-2">So I said, “I am looking, and there <i>is</i> a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top of it, and on the <i>stand</i> seven lamps with <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>seven pipes</strong></span> to the seven lamps. </span> <span id="en-NKJV-22926" class="text Zech-4-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Two olive trees <i>are</i> by it, one at the right of the bowl and the other at its left.” </span> <span id="en-NKJV-22927" class="text Zech-4-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, “What <i>are</i> these, my lord?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-22928" class="text Zech-4-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?”</span>

<span class="text Zech-4-5">And I said, “No, my lord.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-22929" class="text Zech-4-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So he answered and said to me:</span>
