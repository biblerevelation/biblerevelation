<strong>Proverbs 24:23-25</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

Further Sayings of the Wise
23 These things also belong to the wise:

It is not good to show partiality in judgment.
24 He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”
Him the people will curse;
Nations will abhor him.
25 But <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>those who rebuke the wicked will have delight</strong></span>,
And a good blessing will come upon them.
