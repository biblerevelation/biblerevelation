<strong>Proverbs 8:34-35</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

34 Blessed is the man who listens to me,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Watching daily at my gates</strong></span>,
Waiting at the posts of my doors.
35 For whoever finds me <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>finds life</strong></span>,
And obtains favor from the Lord;
