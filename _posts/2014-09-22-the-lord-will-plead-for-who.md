<strong>Proverbs 22:22-23</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not rob the poor</strong></span> because he is poor,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Nor oppress the afflicted</strong></span> at the gate;
23 For the Lord will plead their cause,
And plunder the soul of those who plunder them.

<strong>Proverbs 23:10-11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 Do not remove the ancient landmark,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Nor enter the fields of the fatherless</strong></span>;
11 For their Redeemer is mighty;
He will plead their cause against you.
