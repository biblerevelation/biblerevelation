<strong>Proverbs 11:4-11</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,
But <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>righteousness delivers</strong></span> from death.

5 The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way aright,
But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness.

6 The <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">righteousness of the upright will deliver</span></strong> them,
But the unfaithful will be caught by their lust.

7 When a wicked man dies, his expectation will perish,
And the hope of the unjust perishes.

8 The <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>righteous is delivered</strong></span> from trouble,
And it comes to the wicked instead.

9 The hypocrite with his mouth destroys his neighbor,
But through knowledge the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>righteous will be delivered</strong></span>.

10 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices;
And when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.

11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted,
But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
