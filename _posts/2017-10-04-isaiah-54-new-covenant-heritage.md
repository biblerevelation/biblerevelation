One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar. </span><span id="en-WEB-29158" class="text Gal-4-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children. </span><span id="en-WEB-29159" class="text Gal-4-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But the Jerusalem that is above is free <strong>(GRACE/Sarah)</strong>, which is the mother of us all. </span><span id="en-WEB-29160" class="text Gal-4-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>For it is written,</span>
