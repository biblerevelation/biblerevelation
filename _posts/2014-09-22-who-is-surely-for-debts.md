<strong>Proverbs 22:26-27</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

26 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not be one of those who shakes hands in a pledge</strong></span>,
One of those who is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>surety for debts</strong></span>;
27 If you have nothing with which to pay,
Why should he take away your bed from under you?
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>SURELY FOR DEBTS</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>DON'T BUY ANYTHING IN A CONTRACT PAYMENT BASIS</strong></span></li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">DON'T ASSURE ANY FORM OF PAYMENT, FOR FUTURE</span></strong></li>
</ul>
