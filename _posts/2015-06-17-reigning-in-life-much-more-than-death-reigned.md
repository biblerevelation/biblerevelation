<strong>Romans 5:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 For if by the one manâ€™s offense death reigned through the one, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>much more</strong></span> those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ</strong></span>.)
