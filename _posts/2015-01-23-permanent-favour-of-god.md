<strong>Romans 4:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>David Celebrates the Same Truth</strong>

5 But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness,

<strong>Romans 5:1-2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Faith Triumphs in Trouble</strong>

5 Therefore, having been <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>justified by faith</strong></span>, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>we have</strong></span> access by faith into this grace in which <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>we stand</strong></span>, and rejoice in <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>hope</strong></span> of the glory of God.
<ul>
	<li>we have, we stand : perfect tense in Greek
Once and for all act, never to be repeated.
Position in Christ: favour with God forever</li>
	<li>What makes you think, that doing or not doing will loose your favour, where in the first place you haven't got it by your effort/doing .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Old Testament favour comes and goes</li>
	<li>Joseph had the favour
<ul>
	<li>Joseph was conscious of it, so he choose higher things</li>
	<li>Immediately after that he could interpret dreams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Esther had the favour</li>
	<li>But We have a permanent favour</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>God's favour is vertical</li>
	<li>Studies and education and experiences are Horizontal</li>
	<li>Look vertical</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Who wants the devil's smile when God is smiling at you.</li>
	<li>Be conscious of the Favour light above you</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We are spirits , we live in a house called the body
<ul>
	<li>Eyes are windows</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>We have a soul, part were our emotions are</li>
	<li>We are not emotion, We have emotions</li>
</ul>
<strong>1 John 4:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Consummation of Love</strong>

17 Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>as He is, so are we in this world</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>Don't ask "Am i pleasing to God?"
<ul>
	<li>Ask "Is Christ pleasing to God?", as He is so are we in this world</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Is Christ in the unclouded favour?, as He is so are we in this world</li>
	<li>Is Jesus sick? , as He is so are we in this world.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 5:1-9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Faith Triumphs in Trouble</strong>

5 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>rejoice</strong></span> in hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only that, but we also <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>glory</strong></span> in <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>tribulations</strong></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>knowing that</strong></span> tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>love of God</strong></span> has been poured out in our hearts by <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>the Holy Spirit</strong></span> who was given to us.

<strong>Christ in Our Place</strong>

6 For when we were <strong>still without strength</strong>, in due time <strong>Christ died for the ungodly</strong>. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. 8 But <strong>God demonstrates His own love</strong> toward us, in that while <strong>we were still sinners</strong>, Christ died for us. 9 <strong>Much more</strong> then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be <strong>saved from wrath</strong> through Him.
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #333399;">Glory</span></strong> means <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Rejoice</strong></span> ( same word )</li>
	<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>tribulation</strong></span> means trouble</li>
	<li>tribulation/trouble --&gt; perseverance --&gt; character --&gt; hope</li>
	<li><span style="color: #808000;"><strong>love of God</strong> </span>and <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>the Holy Spirit</strong></span> mentioned first time in the New Testament starting Romans  ( Romans 5:5 )</li>
</ul>
<strong>Magna Carta of the Gospel is Romans</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Romans 1 : Man and their perversion and their sin</li>
	<li>Romans 2 : Talks about Jewish person and how they are also in sin</li>
	<li>Romans 3 : God concluded whole world under sin that He might have mercy up on all and the bible says "and now Righteousness of God has been revealed faith to faith upon all up on all that believes, witnessed by the law and the prophet"</li>
	<li>Romans 4 : He talks about Abraham whom the Jewish people estimate, highly regard of all the personage. God used Abraham as a picture of Justification by faith. How was Abraham made righteous before God?
<ul>
	<li>because of Circumcision? No. Circumcision came after Justification</li>
	<li>because he has not sinned? No. He lied.</li>
	<li>He was justified by faith apart from works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Which implies, God wants us to know the Word of God/Christ Work. Word of God/Christ Work being the first priority. Only in the 5th Chapter, love of God and the Holy Spirit mentioned.</li>
	<li>First God wants outside understanding of the Word/Christ Work, then inside understanding of the Love of God with the Holy Spirit.</li>
	<li>God doesn't want to look at the Spirits work in you</li>
	<li>God wants you to focus on the Christ work outside you</li>
	<li>Don't be confound with Christ work for you and Spirit work inside you.</li>
	<li>Introspective : Feeling and emotions are not that real, alone, its not leading.</li>
	<li>Spirits work in you is fifth in Romans.</li>
	<li>And also another incident: Jesus withheld the sight of two person knowing Him on the day of His resurrection. Jesus expounded in the Old Testament concerning Himself, then after Holy Communion, their eyes were opened.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Person with character developed : Presence makes more weightiness, dignity, radiance, words carry weight even though few words. you are Rock of Gibraltar in the midst of storm toast waves. People find strength in you.</li>
	<li>Others enjoy being in that persons presence, it gives them stability. It gives peace.</li>
	<li>People will seek them out. People want to be around them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>On every trouble, find what you can learn from it, and improve your character</blockquote>
Spirit works when you look at Jesus.
