<strong>James 1:2-6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text Jas-1-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>My brethren, count it all joy <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>when you fall into various trials</strong></span>, </span><span id="en-NKJV-30270" class="text Jas-1-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. </span><span id="en-NKJV-30271" class="text Jas-1-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>But let patience have <i>its</i> perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. </span><span id="en-NKJV-30272" class="text Jas-1-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God</strong></span>, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. </span><span id="en-NKJV-30273" class="text Jas-1-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Trial didn't come from God</li>
	<li>You fell into those trials due to self righteousness</li>
	<li>God will use those trails to make us perfect, complete and at the end <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>WE LACK NOTHING</strong></span></li>
</ul>
