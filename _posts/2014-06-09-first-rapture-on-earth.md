<h3>Hebrews 11:5-6</h3>
<p class="txt-sm">New King James Version (NKJV)</p>

</div>
<div class="passage version-NKJV result-text-style-normal text-html " style="color: #000000;">

<span id="en-NKJV-30178" class="text Heb-11-5"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">5 </span><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death</strong></span>, <span class="oblique">“and was not found, because God had taken him”</span>;  for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-30179" class="text Heb-11-6"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">6 </span>But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>Him,</i> for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and <i>that</i> He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</span>
