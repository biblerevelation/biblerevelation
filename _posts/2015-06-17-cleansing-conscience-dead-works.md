<strong>Hebrews 9:11-14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Heavenly Sanctuary</strong>

11 But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.
12 Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.
13 For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh,
14 how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>cleanse your conscience from dead works</strong></span> to serve the living God?
<strong>Hebrews 9:14</strong>
<strong> New International Version (NIV)</strong>

14 How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death</strong></span>, so that we may serve the living God!
