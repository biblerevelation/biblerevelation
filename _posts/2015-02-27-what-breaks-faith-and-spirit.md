<h2>Faith and Spirit breaks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>when you immerse into bad world news</li>
	<li>When you look around</li>
	<li>when you look horizontal</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to build your faith and Spirit?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Look vertical</li>
	<li>Look unto Jesus</li>
</ul>
<h2>As Jesus is so are we in this world</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus is without sickness</li>
	<li>Jesus is without pain</li>
	<li>Jesus is without sorrow</li>
	<li>Jesus is without addiction</li>
</ul>
<strong>1 John 4:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>as He is, so are we in this world</strong></span>.
<h2>In the wilderness</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Those who look unto the bronze serpant will be saved</li>
	<li>Its a picture of Jesus defeating satan in the cross</li>
	<li>Those who look unto Jesus will be saved</li>
</ul>
