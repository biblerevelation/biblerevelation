<strong>Romans 5:8-10</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 <strong>Much more</strong> then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. 10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">much more</span></strong>, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
<ul>
	<li>Much More than normal life</li>
	<li>Much More than normal health</li>
	<li>Much More than normal healing</li>
	<li>Much More than normal prosperous</li>
</ul>
