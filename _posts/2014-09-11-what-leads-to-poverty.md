<strong>Proverbs 11:24-26</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 There is one who scatters, yet increases more;
And there is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>one who withholds</strong></span> more than is right,
But it leads to poverty.

25 The generous soul will be made rich,
And he who waters will also be watered himself.

26 The people will curse <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>him who withholds grain</strong></span>,
But blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.
