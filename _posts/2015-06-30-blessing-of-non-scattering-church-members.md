<strong>Zechariah 13:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Shepherd Savior</strong>

7 “Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd,
Against the Man who is My Companion,”
Says the Lord of hosts.
“Strike the Shepherd,
And the sheep will be scattered;
Then I will turn My hand against the little ones.

	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Jesus took this curse on Him</strong></span></li>
	<li>When Jesus was captured, all His disciples scattered</li>
	<li>so that our church people won't get scattered.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Non-Scattering Sheep</blockquote>
