<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">1 John 1:9

<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Mark 1:5

<h5><strong>Argument : </strong></h5>
<ul>
	<li>confessing of sins is plural</li>
	<li>confessing of sins is for believers</li>
	<li>confessing of sins is in present tense</li>
</ul>
Present tense is also not just something happening at the moment but it can also mean characteristic

(

<strong>Eg: </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Soap washes,</li>
	<li>Blood of Jesus cleanses ( it is used in present tense but also Characteristic )</li>
</ul>
)
<ul>
	<li>Here it is a characteristic of turning away from sin to God</li>
</ul>
Its a Hebraism for turning from sin to God
