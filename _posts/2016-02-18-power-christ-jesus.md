<p class="passage-display"><strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Romans 6:7-12
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong></p>
<span id="en-NKJV-28076" class="text Rom-6-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>For he who has died has been <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>freed (Justified in Greek)</strong></span> from sin. </span><span id="en-NKJV-28077" class="text Rom-6-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, </span><span id="en-NKJV-28078" class="text Rom-6-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. </span><span id="en-NKJV-28079" class="text Rom-6-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>For <i>the death</i> that He died, He died to sin once for all; but <i>the life</i> that He lives, He lives to God. </span><span id="en-NKJV-28080" class="text Rom-6-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Likewise</strong> </span>you also, reckon (logizomai in Greek means reality. Facts) yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-28081" class="text Rom-6-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Therefore</strong> </span>do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.</span>
<h2><strong>logizomai in Greek meaning</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>i have money in bank means, i have money in bank</li>
	<li>I am a man means i am a man</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/3049.htm">http://biblehub.com/greek/3049.htm</a>
<h2><strong>Likewise</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Did Jesus die to sin in character and conduct?
<ul>
	<li>No</li>
	<li>Because He has no sin in His character and conduct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Similarly we have to reckon ourselves
<ul>
	<li>The way Christ died to sin</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Jesus died to sin to
<ul>
	<li>the Guilt</li>
	<li>the punishment</li>
	<li>the imputation of sin</li>
	<li>the Condemnation</li>
	<li>That was on Him</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Reckon it once and for all
<ul>
	<li>It can never be imputed to you again</li>
	<li>God can never condemn a believer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>In the book of Romans</strong></h2>
sin is mentioned 45 times and only one time it is a verb. Other times its a noun.
<h2><strong>Therefore</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Therefore is based on the previous verse</li>
	<li>Even when you fail, you are not under the guilt, the imputation, the condemnation, and the punishment .. This will let sin not reign.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>in Christ Jesus</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Study all in Christ realities/Truth like
<ul>
	<li>Who you are in Christ</li>
	<li>What you are in Christ</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>All Good things of God is in Christ</li>
	<li>Righteous in Christ</li>
	<li>Inheritance in Christ</li>
</ul>
