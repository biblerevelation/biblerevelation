<h2>For our Sakes</h2>
<strong>Daniel 2:21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 And He changes the times and the seasons;
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>He removes kings and raises up kings</strong></span>;
He gives wisdom to the wise
And knowledge to those who have understanding.

<strong>Daniel 2:30</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-21789" class="text Dan-2-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>for <i>our</i> sakes</strong></span> who make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Kings revolves around Jews and the Church, His people.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Caesar Augustus ordered all the Romans should go from where they came, for taking census, so that all pay tax. God put that thought on to Caesar Augustus heart.</li>
	<li>This resulted in Jesus who supposed to be born in Nazareth, was born in Bethlehem, to fulfil all the Bible Prophesy</li>
	<li>Blessings and Deterioration of nations is for the Gospel</li>
</ul>
