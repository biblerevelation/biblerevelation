<h2>Balak and Balaam</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Balaam is a witch</li>
	<li>Balak told Balaam to curse the People are Isreal</li>
	<li>Instead of Cursing them, Blessing came out of Balaam's mouth
<ul>
	<li>Balaam tried the second time to curse but he failed again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Verses spoken by Balaam</h2>
<h3><strong>Numbers 23:8</strong></h3>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>How shall I curse whom God has not cursed</strong></span>?
And how shall I denounce whom the Lord has not denounced?
<h3><strong>Numbers 23:20</strong></h3>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 Behold, I have received a command to bless;
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it</strong></span>.
<h3>Numbers 23:23</h3>
New King James Version (NKJV)

23 “For there is no sorcery against Jacob,
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Nor any divination against Israel</strong></span>.
It now must be said of Jacob
And of Israel, ‘Oh, what God has done!’
