<strong>Proverbs 23:1-3</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

23 When you sit down to eat with a ruler,
Consider carefully what is before you;
2 And put a knife to your throat
If you are a man given to appetite.
3 Do not desire his delicacies,
For <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>they are deceptive food</strong></span>.
