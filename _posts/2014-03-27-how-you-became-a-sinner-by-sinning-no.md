<h3>Romans 5:19</h3>
New King James Version (NKJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>19 For as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>by one man’s disobedience</strong></span> many were made sinners, so also <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>by one Man’s obedience</strong></span> many will be made righteous.</blockquote>

<h2>How you became a Sinner?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You became a sinner NOT because of your sins</li>
	<li>You became a sinner because of one man's disobedience : Adam</li>
	<li>Wages of sin is death.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So, How you became Righteous after:</h2>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">From the above verse  "by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous". Who's Obedience? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>JESUS</strong></span></span>
<ul>
	<li>By Jesus's obedience we became righteous.</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Jesus died for us and by </span><span style="line-height: 1.5; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>believing</strong></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> on HIM we became Righteous, and shall have <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>everlasting life</strong></span>. </span></li>
	<li>Believing that Jesus died for <strong>*all</strong> our sins ( <strong>*all</strong> : past, present and future sins)</li>
	<li>So it's nothing to do with us to become the Righteousness of God,
<ul>
	<li><strong>example:</strong> seek ye first the Kingdom of God and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HIS</strong></span> righteousness</li>
	<li>We are the Righteousness of God in Christ : when we believe on that and on His love towards us, actual sins(missing the mark) will automatically becomes repulsive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
