<strong>Matthew 6:31-34</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

31 “Therefore do not worry, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>saying</strong></span>, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’

32 For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.

34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
