<h2>Answer</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Aaron was suffering with the people when Israelites were slaves in Egypt
<ul>
	<li>Aaron knows the pain people go through</li>
	<li>Aaron understands the pain people go through</li>
	<li>Aaron can feel the pain people go through</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Moses was in the palace when Israelites were slaves in Egypt
<ul>
	<li>Moses doesn't know or understands or feels the pain people go through</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jesus our High Priest now</h2>
<blockquote>Jesus qualified himself to be a High Priest by going through all sufferings which we go through</blockquote>
<strong>Hebrews 4:15</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-30030" class="text Heb-4-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus became our High Priest.</li>
	<li>Jesus dwelt among us</li>
	<li>Jesus knows our pain</li>
	<li>Jesus knows our sorrow we go through</li>
	<li>Jesus was tested</li>
</ul>
