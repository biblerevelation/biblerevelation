<div class="version-NKJV result-text-style-normal text-html "><strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Hebrews 13:17
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)

</span></strong><span id="en-NKJV-30259" class="text Heb-13-17"><sup class="versenum">17Â </sup><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Obey those who rule over you</strong></span>, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you.</span>
