<strong>John 20:19-20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Apostles Commissioned</strong>

19 Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, “Peace be with you.” 20 When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>disciples were glad when they saw the Lord</strong></span>.
<blockquote>Seeing the Lord makes you Joyful</blockquote>
