<h2>Great Faith</h2>
<h3>Centurion</h3>
<strong>Luke 7:6-9</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-25202" class="text Luke-7-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof</span></strong>. </span><span id="en-NKJV-25203" class="text Luke-7-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You</strong></span>. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. </span><span id="en-NKJV-25204" class="text Luke-7-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does <i>it.</i>”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-25205" class="text Luke-7-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, <span class="woj">“I say to you, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I have not found such great faith</strong></span>, not even in Israel!”</span></span>
<h3>Woman of Canaan</h3>

<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-23659" class="text Matt-15-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23660" class="text Matt-15-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>But He answered and said, <span class="woj">“It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw <i>it</i> to the little dogs.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23661" class="text Matt-15-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>even the little dogs eat the crumbs</strong></span> which fall from their masters’ table.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23662" class="text Matt-15-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Then Jesus answered and said to her, <span class="woj">“<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>O woman, great <i>is</i> your faith!</strong></span> Let it be to you as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</span>
