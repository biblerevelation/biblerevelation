<strong>Proverbs 22:28</strong>

28 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not remove the ancient landmark</strong></span>
Which your fathers have set.

<strong>Proverbs 23:10-11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not remove the ancient landmark</strong></span>,
Nor enter the fields of the fatherless;
11 For their Redeemer is mighty;
He will plead their cause against you.
