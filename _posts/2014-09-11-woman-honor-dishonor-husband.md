<h3><strong>Proverbs 11:16</strong></h3>
<strong>Amplified Bible</strong>
A <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>gracious and good woman wins honor</strong></span> [for her husband], and violent men win riches but a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>woman who hates righteousness is a throne of dishonor for him</strong></span>.

<strong>New King James Version</strong>
A gracious woman retains honor,
But ruthless men retain riches.

<strong>New International Version</strong>
A kindhearted woman gains honor, but ruthless men gain only wealth.

<strong>New Living Translation</strong>
A gracious woman gains respect, but ruthless men gain only wealth.

<strong>English Standard Version</strong>
A gracious woman gets honor, and violent men get riches.

<strong>New American Standard Bible</strong>
A gracious woman attains honor, And ruthless men attain riches.

<strong>King James Bible</strong>
A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.

<strong>Aramaic Bible in Plain English</strong>
A loving woman upholds honor for the husband, but the woman who hates the truth is a throne of disgrace. Lazy men, even in their wealth, are needy, and strong men uphold knowledge.

<strong>Young's Literal Translation</strong>
A gracious woman retaineth honour, And terrible men retain riches.
