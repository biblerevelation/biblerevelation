<h2>Answer:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Everything in Bible has a Predominance</li>
	<li>As you could see from above verses, Wisdom is THE PRINCIPAL THING</li>
	<li>Which clearly says Compared to all Books in the Bible, Proverbs should be our PRINCIPAL BOOK</li>
	<li>That gets confirmed by having exactly 31 Chapters = 31 Prominent days in a month</li>
	<li>That we <strong>"should be reading one Chapter in Proverbs each day"</strong> (for us to keep on Growing as Jesus grew in Wisdom as per Luke 2:52 )</li>
	<li>Finally, Wisdom Comes from Heaven and Jesus is our Wisdom</li>
</ul>
<h2>We SHOULD BE READING ONE CHAPTER in PROVERBS Each Day Sequentially.</h2>
