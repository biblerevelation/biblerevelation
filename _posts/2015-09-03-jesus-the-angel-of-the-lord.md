<h2>THE Angel of the LORD</h2>
<strong>Judges 13:15-21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-6900" class="text Judg-13-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then Manoah said to the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.”</span>

But if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” (For Manoah did not know He <i>was</i> the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.)</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-6902" class="text Judg-13-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Then Manoah said to the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “What <i>is</i> Your name, that when Your words come <i>to pass</i> we may honor You?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-6903" class="text Judg-13-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>And <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span></strong></span> said to him, “Why do you ask My name, seeing <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>it <i>is </i>wonderful </strong></span><strong>( 'PELE' in HEBREW )</strong>?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-6904" class="text Judg-13-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.

When Manoah and his wife saw <i>this,</i> they fell on their faces to the ground. </span><span id="en-NKJV-6906" class="text Judg-13-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>When the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared no more to Manoah and his wife, then Manoah knew that He<i>was</i> the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span>

<strong>Isaiah 9:6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<h2>Names of Jesus</h2>
<ul>

<h3>The Rich Young Ruler</h3>
</div>
<strong>Luke 18:18-19</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text Luke-18-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-25708" class="text Luke-18-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>So Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">“Why do you call Me good? <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>No one <i>is</i> good but One,<i>that is,</i> God</strong></span>.</span></span>
<ul>
	<li>The Rich Young Ruler was actually flattering Jesus</li>
	<li>Jesus indirectly saying, though The Rich Young Ruler used the word "Good" to flatter Jesus, it is the actual truth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Angel of the Lord to Manoah</h3>
<strong>Judges 13:15-16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-6900" class="text Judg-13-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>Then Manoah said to the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-6901" class="text Judg-13-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>And the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Manoah, “Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span></strong></span>.” (For Manoah did not know He <i>was</i> the Angel of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.)</span>
<ul>
	<li>Manoah thinks the Angel of the Lord as a normal man and giving young goat to the Angel of the Lord</li>
	<li>Normally young goat must be offered to the Lord</li>
	<li>So Jesus, the Angel of the Lord saying "if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the <span class="small-caps">Lord". Indirectly it explains that He Himself is the Lord. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Jesus the burnt offering, seen by Manoah</h4>
