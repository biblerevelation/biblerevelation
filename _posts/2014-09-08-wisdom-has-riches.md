<strong>Proverbs 3:16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 Length of days is in her right hand,
In her left hand <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>riches</strong> </span>and honor.

<strong>Proverbs 8:18-21</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

18 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Riches</strong></span> and honor are with me,
Enduring <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>riches</strong> </span>and righteousness.
19 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold,
And my revenue than choice silver.
20 I traverse the way of righteousness,
In the midst of the paths of justice,
21 That I may cause those who love me to <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>inherit wealth</strong></span>,
That I may <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>fill their treasuries</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 14:24</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 The crown of the wise is their <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>riches</strong></span>,But the foolishness of fools is folly.
