<strong>2 Corinthians 5:21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
<h2>Two Blessedness described by David</h2>
<strong>Romans 4:6-8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 just as David also describes the blessedness of the man <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>to whom</strong></span> God imputes righteousness <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>apart from works</strong></span>:

<strong><span style="color: #008000;">7 “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,</span></strong>
<strong><span style="color: #008000;"> And whose sins are covered;</span></strong>
<strong><span style="color: #008000;"> 8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not impute sin.”</span></strong>
<h2>How you know the Righteousness of the Lord</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>From the story of Balaam and Balak</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Micah 6:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 O My people, remember now
What Balak king of Moab counseled,
And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,
From Acacia Grove to Gilgal,
That <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>you may know the righteousness of the Lord</strong></span>.”
<h2>Balak and Balaam</h2>
<h3>Enemies blessing us bountifully</h3>
<strong>Numbers 23:11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have blessed them <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>bountifully</strong></span>!”
<h3>No one can curse what Lord has blessed</h3>
<h4>Irreversible Blessing</h4>

<h2>Error of Balaam</h2>
<strong>Jude 1:11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily in the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>error of Balaam</strong></span> for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.
<ul>
	<li>Don't go after the error of Balaam</li>
	<li>Thinking that God will curse the people whom He has blessed</li>
</ul>
