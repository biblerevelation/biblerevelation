<ul>
	<li>People who criticism you, Judge you and reproach you : Won't affect us any more because,</li>
	<li>Jesus took all our reproaches so that we be without any reproach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>In the name of Jesus when reproach is under our feet, there won't be anyone reproaching us.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 15:3</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me</strong></span>.”
