<strong>Galatians 3:5-14</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 Therefore <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you</strong></span>, does He do it by the works of the law, or <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>by</strong> <strong>the hearing of faith</strong></span>?— 6 just as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” 7 Therefore know that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080; text-decoration: underline;">only</span></span> those who are of faith are sons of Abraham</strong></span>. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, “In you all the nations shall be blessed.” 9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.
