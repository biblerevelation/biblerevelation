<strong>Proverbs 22:14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 The mouth of an immoral woman is a deep pit;
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who is abhorred by the Lord</strong></span> will fall there.

<strong>Proverbs 23:26-28</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

26 My son, give me your heart,
And let your eyes observe my ways.
27 For a harlot is a deep pit,
And a seductress is a narrow well.
28 She also lies in wait as for a victim,
And increases the unfaithful among men.
