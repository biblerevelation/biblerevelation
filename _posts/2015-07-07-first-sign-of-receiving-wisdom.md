<h2>Story of Solomon</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Solomon went to the Mount Gibeon, where Tabernacle of Moses was located</li>
	<li>There was no Presence of God, because the arc of covenant was not there</li>
	<li>Arc: Symbol of Gods Presence</li>
	<li>Solomon gave 1000 burnt offering</li>
	<li>On that night Solomon received wisdom</li>
	<li>First sign of receiving wisdom, Solomon straight went to Zion and he worshiped before the arc</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mount Zion</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Mount zion, picture of Jesus's unmerited favour.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Direction of Wisdom</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Wisdom takes us to the place, where there is the presence of God</li>
</ul>
