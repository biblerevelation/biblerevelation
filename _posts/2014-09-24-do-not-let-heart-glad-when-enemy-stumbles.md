<strong>Proverbs 24:17-20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles</strong></span>;
18 Lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him,
And He turn away His wrath from him.
19 Do not fret because of evildoers,
Nor be envious of the wicked;
20 For there will be no prospect for the evil man;
The lamp of the wicked will be put out.
