<h3>John 11:11-13</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)
<blockquote>11 He said these things, and then added, Our friend Lazarus is at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rest <i>and</i> sleeping</strong></span>; but I am going there that I may awaken him out of his sleep.

12 The disciples answered, Lord, if he is sleeping, he will recover.

13 However, Jesus had<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> spoken of his death</strong></span>, but they thought that He referred to falling into a refreshing <i>and</i> natural sleep.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus said Lazarus is at rest and sleeping. But Jesus spoken of his death.</li>
	<li>For Jesus, Death is like a person being at rest and sleeping.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #008000;">As we are Ambassadors of Christ</span></strong></li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #008000;">God making His appeal as it were through us</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #a44ab5;">So waking up those who are resting and sleeping is our Responsibility. </span></strong></h3>

We [as Christ’s personal representatives] beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [now offered you] <i>and</i> be reconciled to God.</blockquote>
