<strong>Proverbs 24:3-4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 Through <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>wisdom</strong> </span>a house is built,
And by <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>understanding</strong> </span>it is established;
4 By <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>knowledge</strong> </span>the rooms are filled
With all <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>precious and pleasant</strong></span> riches.
