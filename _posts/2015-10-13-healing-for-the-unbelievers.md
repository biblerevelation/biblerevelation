<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">James 5:14-15
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-30369" class="text Jas-5-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. </span><span id="en-NKJV-30370" class="text Jas-5-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.</span>
<h2>For Believers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Sins are forgive ( Perfect Tense ) once for an all. The act doesn't need to be repeated again</li>
</ul>
<h2>For Unbelievers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Sins have ( Future Tense ) to be forgiven,</li>
</ul>
<h2>James 5:15 for sick Unbelievers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>James 5:15 speaks about the healing of Unbelievers, because they are yet to be forgiven.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>For Believers there would be no sins to be forgiven for, because all their sins where forgiven once and for all, on the same time when they believed that Christ Died for their sins.</li>
</ul>
