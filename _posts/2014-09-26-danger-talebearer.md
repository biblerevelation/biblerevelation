<strong>Proverbs 26:20-22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 Where there is no wood, the fire goes out;
And where there is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>no talebearer, strife ceases</strong></span>.
21 As charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,
So is a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>contentious man to kindle strife</strong></span>.
22 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The words</strong></span> of a talebearer are like tasty trifles,
And <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>they go down into the inmost body</strong></span>.

And a furious man abounds in transgression.
