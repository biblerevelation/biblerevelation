<strong>Proverbs 19:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 The king’s <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>wrath</strong> </span>is like <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the roaring of a lion</strong></span>,
But his <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>favor</strong> </span>is like dew on the grass.

<strong>Proverbs 20:2</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

2 The <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>wrath</strong> </span>of a king is like <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the roaring of a lion</strong></span>;
Whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own life.
