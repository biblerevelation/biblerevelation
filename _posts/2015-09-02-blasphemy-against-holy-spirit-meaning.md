<h2><strong>The Unpardonable sin is for who?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Unforgiven sin is for who?</strong></h3>
<strong>Matthew 12:31-32</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text Matt-12-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup><span class="woj">“Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>blasphemy <i>against</i> the Spirit will not be forgiven men</strong></span>.</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-23522" class="text Matt-12-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup><span class="woj">Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him</strong></span>, either in this age or in the <i>age</i> to come.</span></span>
<h3><strong>Its in the context of, Jews constantly Rejecting Jesus</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://biblerevelation.org/2015/09/02/greater-than-jonah/">Rejecting Jesus, Greater than any Prophets</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://biblerevelation.org/2015/09/02/greater-than-any-priests/">Rejecting Jesus, Greater than any Priests</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://biblerevelation.org/2015/09/02/greater-than-solomon/">Rejecting Jesus, Greater than any Kings</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>"Matthew written for Jews"</strong>
<h3><strong>Jews constantly rejected Jesus, so Jesus spoke</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>"the blasphemy <i>against</i> the Spirit will not be forgiven men"</li>
	<li>"whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him"</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>So, This is not for the Believers</strong></h3>
Blasphemy against the Spirit:
<ul>
	<li>You became a believer only after accepting Jesus</li>
	<li>Blasphemy against the Spirit means not accepting Jesus ( knowingly/willingly rejecting Jesus after seeing all His works )</li>
	<li>This is for Jews at that time, who saw the works of Jesus and rejected Him</li>
	<li>This might not be even for Present Jews</li>
	<li>This might not be even for Present Unbelievers</li>
</ul>

<span class="text Matt-11-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>At that time, Jesus answered, <span class="woj">“<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth</strong></span>, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>infants</strong></span>. </span></span><span id="en-WEB-23486" class="text Matt-11-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup><span class="woj">Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.</span> </span><span id="en-WEB-23487" class="text Matt-11-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup><span class="woj">All things have been delivered to me by my Father.
