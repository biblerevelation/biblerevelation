<strong>Proverbs 24:1-2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

1 <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Do not be envious of evil men</span></strong>,
Nor desire to be with them;
2 For their heart devises violence,
And their lips talk of troublemaking.

<strong>Proverbs 24:17-20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles;
18 Lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him,
And He turn away His wrath from him.
19 Do not fret because of evildoers,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Nor be envious of the wicked</strong></span>;
20 For there will be no prospect for the evil man;
The lamp of the wicked will be put out.
