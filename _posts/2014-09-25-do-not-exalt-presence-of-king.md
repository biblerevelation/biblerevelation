<strong>Proverbs 25:6-7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king</strong></span>,
And do not stand in the place of the great;
7 For it is better that he say to you,
“Come up here,”
Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,
Whom your eyes have seen.
