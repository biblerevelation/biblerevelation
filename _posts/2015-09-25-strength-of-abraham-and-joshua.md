<h2>Abraham Ran at the age of 99</h2>
<strong>Genesis 18:1-2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<p class="chapter-2"><span class="text Gen-18-1"><span class="chapternum">18 </span>Then the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre,<sup class="footnote" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 0.625em; line-height: 22px; position: relative; vertical-align: top; top: 0px;" data-fn="#fen-NKJV-426a" data-link="[&lt;a href=&quot;#fen-NKJV-426a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;]">[<a title="See footnote a" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+18%3A1-2&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-426a">a</a>]</sup> as he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day. </span><span id="en-NKJV-427" class="text Gen-18-2"><sup class="versenum">2 </sup>So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw <i>them,</i> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>he ran</strong></span> from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground,</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="chapter-2">Abraham ran at the age of 99 when he saw the Lord</li>
	<li class="chapter-2">Ran means he got strength even at the age 99</li>
</ul>
<h2>Joshua so strong at the age of 85</h2>
<strong>Joshua 14:10-11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-6198" class="text Josh-14-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>And now, behold, the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> has kept me alive, as He said, these <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>forty-five years</strong></span>, ever since the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>eighty-five years old</strong></span>. </span><span id="en-NKJV-6199" class="text Josh-14-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>As yet <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I <i>am as</i> strong</strong></span> this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength <i>was</i> then, so now <i>is</i> my strength for war, both for going out and for coming in.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Joshua was so strong at the age of 85, same strength as he had at the age of 45</li>
	<li>Which means Joshua's strength has not decreased</li>
</ul>
In this New Testament period, We have received all these blessings through Jesus Christ
