Proverbs 3:13-18
New King James Version (NKJV)

13 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Happy</strong> </span>is the man who finds wisdom,
And the man who gains understanding;
14 For her proceeds are better than the profits of silver,
And her gain than fine gold.
15 She is more precious than rubies,
And all the things you may desire cannot compare with her.
16 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Length of days</strong></span> is in her right hand,
In her left hand <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>riches</strong> </span>and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>honor</strong></span>.
17 Her ways are ways of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>pleasantness</strong></span>,
And all her paths are <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>peace</strong></span>.
18 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her</strong></span>,
And <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>happy</strong> </span>are all who retain her.
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff00ff;">WisdomÂ is a tree of life to those who take hold of her</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus is the Tree of Life</li>
	<li>Wisdom is not an object or Thing</li>
	<li>Wisdom is a person</li>
	<li>Jesus is our Wisdom</li>
</ul>
<strong>Proverbs 8:27</strong>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

27 <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>When He prepared the heavens</strong></span>, I [Wisdom] was there; when He drew a circle upon the face of the deep and stretched out the firmament over it,
