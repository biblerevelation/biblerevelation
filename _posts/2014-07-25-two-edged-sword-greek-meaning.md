<h2><span style="color: #800080;">Two-Mouthed</span></h2>
<h4><strong>Isaiah 55:11</strong></h4>
New King James Version (NKJV)

11 So shall <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>My word be that goes forth from My mouth</strong></span>;
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>It shall not return to Me void</strong></span>,
But it shall accomplish what I please,
And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">My word (Word of God) be that goes forth from My mouth</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;">How It shall not "return" to Me (God) void?</span></span></h4>
How you <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>return</strong></span> It back?
<ul>
	<li>First, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Word of God goes forth from the mouth of God</span></strong></li>
	<li>Second, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>We speak it again with our mouth</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #800080;"><strong>NOW</strong></span>,
<ul>
	<li>Now it became <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>"Two-Mouthed"</strong></span></li>
	<li>And Hence <strong><span style="color: #008000;">The Word of God is returned</span></strong></li>
	<li>And Hence it doesn't return void</li>
	<li>And Hence it becomes sharper</li>
	<li>And Hence it becomes powerful</li>
	<li>And Hence it gives life</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;"><strong>SO SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>Don't just read the Word of God in mind. Speak It out.</li>
	<li>Speak out the blessings.</li>
	<li>Speak out the provisions.</li>
	<li>Speak out the Authority that Jesus gave to us ( Kingship, Sonship, Priests )</li>
</ul>
<h3>Word of God becomes non void, when we speak</h3>
<h4><strong>Deuteronomy 32:47</strong></h4>
New King James Version (NKJV)

47 For it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #008080; text-decoration: underline;">not a futile</span></strong></span> thing<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>(dabar)</strong></span> for you, because it is your life, and by this word<strong><span style="color: #ff9900;">(dabar)</span></strong> you shall prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess.”
<ul>
	<li>word = "dabar" in hebrew</li>
	<li>"dabar" means speaking, utterance</li>

<h2>Two-Edged sword Bible Verses</h2>
<h4><strong>Psalm 149:6</strong></h4>

And a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>two-edged</strong></span> sword in their hand,
<h4><strong>Hebrews 4:12</strong></h4>
