<h3>John 8:31</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #9f47b7;"><strong>my word</strong></span>, then are ye my disciples indeed;</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Jews study bible from when they were small age</li>
	<li>Jews already know 10 Commandments</li>
	<li>From the first 5 Books of bible, there are 613 commandments ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments ). Jews study all from their young age</li>
</ul>
Jesus said "<span style="color: #9f47b7;"><strong>My Word</strong></span>" to Jews
<ul>
	<li>Very Clear that , "My word" is not 10 Commandments / Law</li>
</ul>
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">"My Word" is "The Truth". (i.e. 10 Commandments / Law is not the Truth )</span>
<h3>Commandments say</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Do Good --&gt; Get Good</li>
	<li>Do Bad --&gt; Get Bad</li>
	<li>Do Good --&gt; God bless you</li>
	<li>Do Bad --&gt; Curses come over you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Very clear that, Jesus is not mentioning these commandments as "My Word"</h2>
"My Word" --&gt; "The Truth" --&gt; Set's us free &amp; Makes us His disciples

Commandments / Law --&gt; <strong>DOESN'T</strong> sets you free &amp; <strong>DOESN'T</strong> makes you His Disciple.
