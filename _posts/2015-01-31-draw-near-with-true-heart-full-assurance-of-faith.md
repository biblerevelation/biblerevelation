<strong>Hebrews 10:15-25</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,

16 “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,” 17 then He adds, “Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.” 18 Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.

<strong>Hold Fast Your Confession</strong>

19 Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, 20 by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh, 21 and having a High Priest over the house of God, 22 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>let us draw near</strong></span> <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>with a true heart</strong></span> <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>in full assurance</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #800080;">of faith</span></strong>, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful. 24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.

<strong>Hebrews 10:1-4</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Animal Sacrifices Insufficient</strong>

10 For <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things</strong></span>, can never with these same sacrifices, which they <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>offer continually year by year</strong></span>, make those who approach <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>perfect</strong></span>. 2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>once</strong></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>purified</strong></span>, would have had <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>no more consciousness of sins</strong></span>. 3 But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. 4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.

All the offering of the Old Testament are shadows of the substance. Jesus is the substance. If the Substance is here why do we need to go for shadow?
<ul>
	<li>The burn offering</li>
	<li>The meal offering</li>
	<li>The peace offering</li>
	<li>The sin and trespass offering</li>

<h2>Perfect not pertaining to our behaviour, Perfect in our conscious</h2>
<strong>Hebrews 9:9-10</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

9 It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>perfect in regard to the conscience</strong></span>— 10 concerned only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.

<strong>1 John 5:13</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>that you may <span style="color: #008000;">know</span> that you have <span style="color: #993366;">eternal life</span></strong></span>, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
<h2>Love of God</h2>
<strong>John 3:16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 For <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>God <span style="color: #ff00ff;">so</span> loved the world</strong></span> that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
<ul>
	<li>It was God who loved us</li>
	<li>It was God who gave His Son</li>
	<li>It was God who wants us free from sin consciousness</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Because God wants us to draw near to him with a true heart in full assurance of faith</blockquote>
