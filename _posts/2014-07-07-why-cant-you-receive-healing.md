<h1 class="passage-display" style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;"><span class="passage-display-bcv">Galatians 5:4</span></h1>
<p class="passage-display" style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;"><span class="passage-display-version">King James Version (KJV)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span id="en-KJV-29167" class="text Gal-5-4"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">4Â </span>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">justified by the law</span></strong>; ye are fallen from grace.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="color: #000000;">Christ is become of no effect unto you</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When you are justified by the law</li>
	<li><strong>Note:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not</span> when you sin</li>
</ul>
<h2>i.e.:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Healing becomes no effect</strong></span> when you are justified by the law</li>
	<li>Promises of God becomes no effect when you are justified by the law</li>
	<li>Blessings becomes no effect when you are justified by the law</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>"ye are fallen from grace", which means grace is above the law</li>
	<li>Fallen from grace means you have fallen from grace to the Law</li>
</ul>
