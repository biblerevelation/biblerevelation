<h3>God making His appeal as it were through us</h3>
<h3>2 Corinthians 5:20</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

</div>
<div>

20 So we are Christ’s ambassadors, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>God making His appeal as it were through us</strong></span>. We [as Christ’s personal representatives] beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [now offered you] <i>and</i> be reconciled to God.
<ul>
	<li>We are Christ's ambassadors</li>
	<li>God making His appeal as it were through us</li>
	<li>So its our responsibility to Heal the sick, Calm the storm, Stop the earthquake on happening.</li>
</ul>
