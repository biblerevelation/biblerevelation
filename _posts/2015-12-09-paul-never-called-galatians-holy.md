<h2><strong>Galatians introduced the Law</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Paul never called Galatians as Holy</li>
	<li>Even Corinthians Paul called them as Holy / Sanctified / Saints People</li>
</ul>
Because they introduced the Law
<h3><strong>Paul started Galatians with Double curse</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Double curse for people who preach any other Gospel</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Galatians 1:6-9
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span class="text Gal-1-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>different gospel</strong></span>, </span><span id="en-NKJV-29065" class="text Gal-1-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. </span><span id="en-NKJV-29066" class="text Gal-1-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>any other gospel</strong></span> to you than what we have preached to you, let him be <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>accursed</strong></span>. </span><span id="en-NKJV-29067" class="text Gal-1-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>any other gospel</strong></span> to you than what you have received, let him be <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>accursed</strong></span>.</span>
<h2><strong>Corinthians was a carnal church</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>but still Paul mentioned them as Holy / Sanctified / Saints</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">1 Corinthians 1:9
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-28373" class="text 1Cor-1-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>God <i>is</i> faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
