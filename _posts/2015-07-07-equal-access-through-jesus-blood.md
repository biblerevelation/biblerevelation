<h2>Equal access toÂ every child of God</h2>
<ul>
	<li>for the Fathers ear</li>
	<li>Every prayer of a child of God enters in to the Holy of Holies</li>
</ul>
<h2>Because</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Same blood which removed our sins tore the wail, for us to come in boldly</li>
	<li>Wail was torn from top to bottom because, its God who tore the wail</li>
</ul>
<h2>Having High Priests access</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the Old Testament, only High Priests are allowed inside the Holy of Holies.</li>
</ul>
