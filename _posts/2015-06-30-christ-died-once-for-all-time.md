<h2><strong>Peter 3:18</strong></h2>
<strong>New Living Translation (NLT)</strong>

<h2><strong>Hebrews 7:27</strong></h2>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

27 who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the peopleâ€™s, for this <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>He did once for all</strong></span> when He offered up Himself.
<h2><strong>Hebrews 9:12</strong></h2>
