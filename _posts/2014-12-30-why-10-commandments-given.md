<blockquote>10 Commandments is the Law</blockquote>
<h2>Law was not created to make you Righteous</h2>
<strong>Romans 3:20</strong>
<strong> New International Version (NIV)</strong>

20 Therefore <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law</strong></span>; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
<h2>By the law is the knowledge of sin</h2>
<strong>Romans 3:20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>by the law is the knowledge of sin</strong></span>.
