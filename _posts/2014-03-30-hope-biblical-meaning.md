<h2>Biblical meaning of Hope</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Confident</strong></span> expectation of <strong>Good</strong> (Good Only) : This is the Proper translation from Hebrew.</li>
	<li>Never Bad : No Bad at all.</li>
	<li>Definite Answer</li>
	<li>100% receiving only, Never &lt; 100%</li>
	<li>complete/perfect expectation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Worldly Meaning of Hope</h2>
<ul>
	<li>a "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>feeling</strong></span>" of expectation and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>desire</strong></span> for a particular thing to happen.</li>
	<li>No Definite Answer</li>
	<li>Mixed with both good and bad</li>
	<li>ALWAYS 100% is difficult. Most of the cases its NOT 100%</li>
	<li><strong>eg:</strong> lets hope the best ( in the mind thinking : worst also could happen )</li>
</ul>
<h2>Provider of Confident Hope</h2>
