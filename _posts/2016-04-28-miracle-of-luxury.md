<ul>
 	<li>First miracle of Jesus :Turning water in to wine</li>
 	<li>That shows the heart of Jesus</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Our blessings are not based on our needs</li>
 	<li>Our blessings are based on our wants</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Psalm 23:1
</span><span class="passage-display-version">King James Version (KJV)</span></strong>
<p class="chapter-2"><span id="en-KJV-14237" class="text Ps-23-1"><span class="chapternum">23 </span>The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> is my shepherd; <strong>I shall not <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">want</span></strong>.</span></p>

<h2 class="chapter-2"><strong>Peter's want</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>No one got healed at this situation</li>
 	<li>No one got delivered from demons</li>
 	<li>But it was a personal <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>want</strong> </span>of Peter</li>
 	<li>Personal desire on Peter's part</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Matthew 14:28-29
</span><span class="passage-display-version">World English Bible (WEB)</span></strong>

<span id="en-WEB-23626" class="text Matt-14-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.”
</span><span id="en-WEB-23627" class="text Matt-14-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>He said, <span class="woj">“Come!”
</span></span><span class="text Matt-14-29">Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.</span>
<ul>
 	<li>If you have desire to walk in the water, you can walk</li>
 	<li>Peter had desire to walk in the water and he walked.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Take more</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Believe for no pimple</li>
 	<li>Take more</li>
 	<li>Oh you are little faith means Oh you of little taking
<ul>
 	<li>Take more from Jesus</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>God will drop on purpose
<ul>
 	<li>Like Boaz did to Ruth</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>God doesn't meets your needs according to your needs; He meets your needs according to HIS RICHES.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>His Love</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>He loves for you to take</li>
 	<li>He never complained of you taking more</li>
 	<li>He complained only when you take less ( "Oh you of little faith" )</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>THE LOVE always wants to give</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>THE LOVE will be happy when you receive.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Let no one reproach you</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Let no one reproach you, keep on taking ( Example situation: Boaz to His workers )</li>
 	<li>Martha was trying to reproach Mary when Mary was trying to take from Jesus ( Mary sitting down, doing nothing, just taking form Jesus )
<ul>
 	<li>Jesus rebuked Martha
<ul>
 	<li>"Leave her alone, Mary has chosen the good path"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
