<h2>Justified by faith, we have peace</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Not Justified by our Feelings, we have peace with God</li>
	<li>Not Justified by our Holiness, we have peace with God</li>
	<li>Not Justified by our Actions, we have peace with God</li>
	<li>Not Justified by our Doings, we have peace with God</li>
</ul>
