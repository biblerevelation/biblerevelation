<h2>How to Glorify?</h2>
By being healthy
<h2>How to be Healthy?</h2>
Flee sexual immorality
<h2>Why it affects your body?</h2>
Because its a sin against your own body
<h2>Reference</h2>
<strong>1 Corinthians 6:18-20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-28486" class="text 1Cor-6-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Flee sexual immorality</span></strong>. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sins against his own body</strong></span>. </span><span id="en-NKJV-28487" class="text 1Cor-6-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit <i>who is</i> in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? </span><span id="en-NKJV-28488" class="text 1Cor-6-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>For you were bought at a price; therefore <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>glorify God in your body</strong></span> and in your spirit, <strong>which are God’s.</strong></span>
