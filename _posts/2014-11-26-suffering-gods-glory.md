<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Whatever Jesus suffered for us, we don't need to suffer</strong></span>
<h2>Reward in heaven</h2>
<strong>Matthew 5:11-12</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 “Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. 12 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

<strong>Matthew 10:22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
22 And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.

<strong>2 Timothy 3:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
12 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

<strong>1 Peter 3:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
17 For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.

<strong>1 Peter 3:14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.”
<h2>Suffering for God’s Glory</h2>
<strong>1 Peter 4:12-19</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; 13 but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. 14 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people’s matters. 16 Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.

17 For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? 18 Now

“If the righteous one is scarcely saved,
Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?”

19 Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.
<h2>No evil shall touch you in the seventh day</h2>
<strong>Job 5:19</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

19 He shall deliver you in six troubles,
Yes, in seven <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>no evil shall touch you</strong></span>.
