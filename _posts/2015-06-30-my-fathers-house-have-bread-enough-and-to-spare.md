<h2>Elisha Feeds One Hundred Men</h2>
<strong>2 Kings 4:42-43</strong>

<strong>New King James Version ( NKJV )</strong>

<span class="text 2Kgs-4-42"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup><strong>Then</strong> a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the <strong>firstfruits</strong>, twenty loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, “Give <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-9647" class="text 2Kgs-4-43"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>But his servant said, “What? Shall I set this before one hundred men?”</span>

<span class="text 2Kgs-4-43">He said again, “Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: ‘They shall eat and have <i>some</i> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>left over</strong></span>.’” </span><span id="en-NKJV-9648" class="text 2Kgs-4-44"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>So he set <i>it</i> before them; and they ate and had <i>some</i> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>left over</strong></span>, according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span>
<h2>Feeding the Five Thousand</h2>
<strong>Matthew 14:13-21</strong>

<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text Matt-14-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities. </span><span id="en-NKJV-23612" class="text Matt-14-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick. </span><span id="en-NKJV-23613" class="text Matt-14-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23614" class="text Matt-14-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>But Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">“They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23615" class="text Matt-14-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>And they said to Him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-23616" class="text Matt-14-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>He said, <span class="woj">“Bring them here to Me.”</span> </span><span id="en-NKJV-23617" class="text Matt-14-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. </span><span id="en-NKJV-23618" class="text Matt-14-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained</strong></span>.</span><span id="en-NKJV-23619" class="text Matt-14-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span>
<h2>Size and Style for two miracles</h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Elisha : one hundred men</li>
	<li>Lord Jesus fed : 5000 men not counting women and children --&gt; 12 Basket full left over.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Style</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Elisha has to say "thus says the Lord" ( Elisha used the name of Jesus to feed the people )  ( Elisha is a servant )</li>
	<li>Jesus doesn't need to say "thus says the Lord" because HE IS THE LORD</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus feed the 5000 in a desert place, in the wilderness</li>
	<li>What's man's wilderness is Lords store house</li>
</ul>
