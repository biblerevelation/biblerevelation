<h3>
Matthew 4:2-4</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

2 After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.

"*Jesus was #physically hungry*"

3 The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”

"*Jesus is to tell the solution to solve #physical hunger*"

4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
<h2>*Thus Solution to solve physical hunger : *</h2>
1. Not only by Bread
2. But also on #every word that comes from the mouth of God

Hence a man can live without eating PHYSICAL food as per Bible
