<h2><strong>Jesus Paid for it</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus paid for our eternal life</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Explanation</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Galatians 6:6-10
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span class="text Gal-6-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-29196" class="text Gal-6-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. </span><span id="en-NKJV-29197" class="text Gal-6-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>everlasting life</strong></span>. </span><span id="en-NKJV-29198" class="text Gal-6-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. </span><span id="en-NKJV-29199" class="text Gal-6-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</span>

<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">1 Timothy 6:17-19
</span></strong><strong><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span class="text 1Tim-6-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. </span><span id="en-NKJV-29807" class="text 1Tim-6-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup><i>Let them</i> do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share, </span><span id="en-NKJV-29808" class="text 1Tim-6-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>eternal life</strong></span>.</span>
<h3><strong>Example</strong></h3>
Imagine we bless a person, from your heart ( with out speaking it out )
<ul>
	<li>We bless them because of the Eternal life in us
<ul>
	<li>Eternal Life is in us</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Even though no one knows it, we might feel some sense happiness/joy inside us.</li>
	<li>Now we are reaping it through our emotions</li>
	<li>We experience eternal life even in our body</li>
	<li>Reaping within us</li>
	<li>We are laying hold on eternal life.</li>
</ul>
