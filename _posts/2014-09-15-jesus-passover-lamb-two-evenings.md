22 My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?
Why are You so far from helping Me,
And from the words of My groaning?
2 O My God, I <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cry</strong> </span></span>in the daytime, but You do not hear;
And in the night season, and am not silent.
3 But You are holy,
Enthroned in the praises of Israel.
