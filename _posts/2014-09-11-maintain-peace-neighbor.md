<strong>Proverbs 11:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 He who is devoid of wisdom <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">despises</span> </strong>his neighbor,
But a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>man of understanding holds his peace</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 14:20-21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 The poor man is hated even by his own neighbor,But the rich has many friends.

21 He who <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>despises</strong></span> his neighbor sins;But he who has mercy on the poor, happy is he.

<strong>Proverbs 24:28-29</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

28 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause</strong></span>,
For <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>would you deceive with your lips</strong></span>?
29 Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me;
I will render to the man according to his work.”

<strong>Proverbs 25:8-10</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not go hastily to court</strong></span>;
For what will you do in the end,
When your neighbor has put you to shame?
9 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Debate your case with your neighbor</strong></span>,
And do not disclose the secret to another;
10 Lest he who hears it expose your shame,
And your reputation be ruined.

<strong>Proverbs 25:17-18</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house,
Lest he become weary of you and hate you.
18 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>A man who bears false witness against his neighbor</strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> Is like a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 26:18-19</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

18 Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death,
19 Is the man who deceives his neighbor,
And says, “I was only joking!”
