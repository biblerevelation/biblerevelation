<h2>Heir of the World</h2>
<strong>Obadiah 1:17</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Israel’s Final Triumph</strong>

17 “But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance,
And there shall be holiness;
The house of Jacob <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>shall possess their possessions</strong></span>.

People of the God needs to do something
<ul>
	<li>One thing is to they shall possess their possessions. Another thing is to posses it.</li>
	<li>One thing is to they shall inherit their inheritance. Another thing is to inherit it.</li>
	<li>One thing is to there shall be deliverance. Another thing is to be delivered</li>
</ul>
Many of the places in Israel rightly belong to Israelites which could be possessed by Jacob. But Jacob possessed only a part of it.
<h3>Heir</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One who receives his allotted possession by right of sonship</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 4:13</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 For the promise that he would be the <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>heir of the world</strong></span> was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>righteousness of faith</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>Promises are of no effect</li>
	<li>Faith void</li>
</ul>
NOT through the law, but through the righteousness of faith
<h3>Being a Heir includes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Health</li>
	<li>Healing</li>
	<li>Prosperity</li>
	<li>Happiness</li>
	<li>Joy</li>
	<li>Peace</li>
</ul>
<h3>Galatians 4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Nepios : infant old testament ( People under Law ) He cannot drive father's Lamborghini</li>
	<li> Nothing to do with spiritual growth</li>
	<li>Adoption in greek is there : not correct meaning ( placement of son  )</li>
</ul>
<h3>Its all about Inheritance</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jews fighting for their Land when all is theirs because they are under law.</li>
	<li>Inherit Vs Fight for it</li>
	<li>Nothing to do with how good you are? how bad you are ?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Psalm 44:3</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 For they did not gain possession of the land by their own sword,
Nor did their own arm save them;
But it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your countenance,
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Because You favored them</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>Both to the believers
<ul>
	<li>Romans : you cannot justified by the law</li>
	<li>Galatians : you cannot be sanctified by the law ( you cannot live a holy life by the law )</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Two Covenants</h2>
<strong>Galatians 4:21-31</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. 23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, 24 which things are symbolic. For these are the[a] two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar— 25 for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children— 26 but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. 27 For it is written:

“Rejoice, O barren,
You who do not bear!
Break forth and shout,
You who are not in labor!
For the desolate has many more children
Than she who has a husband.”
28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. 29 But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now. 30 Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.” 31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.

5 Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.

<strong>Exodus 23:25-33</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

25 “So you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will take sickness away from the midst of you. 26 <strong><span style="color: #008000;">No one shall suffer miscarriage or be barren</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">in your land</span></strong>; I will fulfill the number of your days.

27 “I will send My fear before you, I will cause confusion among all the people to whom you come, and will make all your enemies turn their backs to you. 28 And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before you. 29 I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you. 30 <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Little by little</strong></span> I will drive them out from before you, until you have <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">increased (parah - fruitful )</span></strong>, and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>you inherit the land</strong></span>. 31 And I will set your bounds from the Red Sea to the sea, Philistia, and from the desert to the River.[a] For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you. 32 You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 33 They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against Me. For if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.”
<ul>
	<li>Hornets : wasps</li>
	<li>Hornets means sera... - find source -...  in hebrew, root word is leprosy (ethemology )
<ul>
	<li>God send diseases even among the enemies</li>
	<li>God uses small things ( could be non weapon kind of things )</li>
	<li>God use small things to confound the strong enemies</li>
	<li>E.g. Ezekiel 38 , God used hail stones and earth quake</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>in your land : in your inheritance</li>
	<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Healing included in your</strong></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>inheritance</strong></span></li>
	<li>Blessings in your inheritance</li>
	<li>number of days in your inheritance</li>
	<li>Even the good water has to be blessed</li>
	<li>As long as Israel is in the Land, God says "I will do these things for you"</li>
	<li>Land for them is physical land, for us its inheritance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why still We haven't inherited all our inheritance?</h2>
<strong>Why I haven't received it?</strong>
<strong>Why its so slow? </strong>

<strong>Joshua 1:3</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses.
<ul>
	<li>Already God said "Entire land is yours"</li>
	<li>Just walk, daily thing, effortless, rest</li>
	<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Little by Little</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Until you have increased</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>God waiting for you to be strong</li>
	<li>then you will inherit the land</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Being Fruitful first</h3>
This applies for Company, Church, Family..etc
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">increased (parah - fruitful )</span></strong>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus born in iprathah Bethlehem ( 2 Bethlehems in Israel, One is north, another one where Jesus was born)</li>
	<li>iparahth means fruitfulness</li>
	<li>He was born in fruitfulness house of bread.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>First words of God</h3>
<strong>Genesis 1:28</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Be fruitful</strong></span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>multiply</strong></span>; <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>fill the earth</strong></span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>subdue</strong></span> it; have <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>dominion</strong></span> over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
<blockquote>First words of God to men is Grace</blockquote>
<h4>Grace, 5 points</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Be Fruitful</li>
	<li>Multiply</li>
	<li>Fill the earth</li>
	<li>Subdue</li>
	<li>Dominion</li>
</ol>
E.g. Google
<ul>
	<li>First be fruitful : Motivate each of the employees to be Fruitful ( don't look for expansion first )</li>
	<li>Multiply</li>
	<li>Then you will fill the earth with Brand name</li>
	<li>Then you can control it
<ul>
	<li>Control of a company / Church : May the control be in the hands of those who are meek, in the hands those who are righteous, in the hands of those who are kind and then you have dominion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Dominion not over the man. Dominion over the sky, the sea, the land</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Righteousness of God by Faith</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When ever you says "I am the righteousness of God in Christ", you inherit little by little</li>
	<li>Then you see things happen, for you, in you, through you and around you</li>
	<li>Get back the Righteousness consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 4:13</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Promise Granted Through Faith</strong>

13 For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the righteousness of faith</strong></span>.
<h3>2. The word of Grace</h3>
<strong>Acts 20:29-32</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

29 For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. 31 Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.

32 “So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the word of His grace</strong></span>, which is able to <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>build you up</strong></span> and <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>give you an inheritance</strong></span> among all <strong>those who are sanctified ( Believers )</strong>.
<ol>
	<li>Build you up</li>
	<li>Give you an inheritance</li>
</ol>

	<li>Pervert means, there is something original</li>
	<li>Bible has different expressions : Word of His power, Word of His truth. But this is specifically about the Word of His grace</li>
</ul>

	<li>Have a revelation</li>
	<li>First day of the week they broke bread house to house in the chapter of Acts, they came together</li>

	<li>Demons flee</li>
	<li>If you go by the Lord's death, your inheritance is yours
<ul>
	<li>they (Angels, demons ) say that this is the most powerful man</li>
</ul>

	<li>Don't be lofty and proud like, what these small things can do. This is most powerful than radiation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>You will confuse enemies</li>
	<li>You will confuse the demonic force</li>
</ul>
<h2>Can i hurt my inheritance by my sin?</h2>
