<h2>In Song of Songs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Farmer boy is in love with her.</li>
	<li>She is in love with the former boy</li>
	<li>The King is in love with a country girl</li>
	<li>When Solomon want to wood that girl, he came in disguise of a country boy</li>
	<li>That is the picture of King of all Kings ( Jesus Christ ) , when He came to us, He came in a lowly way</li>
	<li>Jesus is rich but He came in to a poor family ( which can be proved when Mary gave 2 doves , which normally only Poor people will give )</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Marry came from Natan, David's son</li>
	<li>Joseph came from Solomon son</li>
	<li>Because of the curse on a king, Johoyakin a king of Judah, they became poor</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Ox = Very Rich</li>
	<li>Lamp = Middle income</li>
	<li>Pair of Doves = Poor</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus didn't remain poor</li>
	<li>Wherever Jesus is , Gold will come, Myrh and Frankisense . Jesus sponsored His flight to Alexandra after that.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Song of Songs is like</h3>
Watching a play
<ul>
	<li>Daughters of Jerusalem narrating</li>
	<li>Beloved narating</li>
	<li>Shepherd king narrating</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feminine Speciality</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Picture of Church</li>
	<li>You are the one receiving the love/protection</li>
	<li>You are made to be loved</li>
	<li>you are not made to be rule the man</li>
	<li>Equal position but not same function</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>First thing she says, let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth ( to the pure all things are pure )</li>
	<li>Love does not wants the knowledge from a far, Love wants intimacy.</li>
	<li>We are here not just to know about Jesus, but to draw near to Him</li>
	<li>We want Him to kiss us</li>
	<li>The word worship in Hebrew http://biblehub.com/greek/4352.htm proskuneo is also called to kiss</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We normally don't give kisses freely and we are very careful about our kisses</li>
	<li>To kiss you should come near</li>
</ul>
<h3>Joseph Story</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Joseph Told to his brothers, even after they betrayed him, "Come near to me"</li>
	<li>Then he says "you will dwell in goshan " :</li>
	<li>Goshan in Hebrew its called drawing near</li>
	<li>And their ( in the place of nearness ), i will provide for you</li>
	<li>i will feed you</li>
	<li>I will protect you and your loved ones and your little ones</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>We are all near to God</li>
	<li>But we have to be near to Jesus ( all are not near to Jesus )</li>
	<li>There was 70 disciples around Jesus when He walked on earth.</li>
	<li>Later on 12 remained
Many of the 70 left</li>
	<li>Out of twelve there were 3 who were closer ( Peter, James , John )</li>
	<li>Out of three one is even closer ( John )</li>
</ul>
<strong>Song of Solomon 1:7-8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong><span id="en-NKJV-17545" class="text Song-1-7">(To Her Beloved)</span></strong>

<span class="text Song-1-7">Where you feed <i>your flock,</i></span>
<span class="text Song-1-7">Where you make <i>it</i> rest at noon.</span>

<span class="text Song-1-8">And feed your little goats</span>

</div>
<h3>Good Shepherds</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Feed</li>
	<li>Rest</li>
</ol>
<h3>O fairest among women</h3>
<ul>
	<li>God does not love you after you have come and arrive at a place of holiness</li>
	<li>He loves you from the start of your Journey</li>
	<li>But He sees you as most beautiful among women</li>
	<li>Fairest in Hebrew : http://biblehub.com/hebrew/3303.htm yapheh , which means beautiful</li>
</ul>
<h3>Follow in the footsteps of the flock</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This is the answer for question "You know where your Lord is?"</li>
	<li>Answer : Go to church</li>

	<li>Please where the Lord feeding the Goats, besides where the shepherd tent</li>
	<li>When we come together then its shepherd's tent</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tent</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Tent is temporal</li>
	<li>Buildings are temporal</li>
	<li>Thats why we use our money to serve Him</li>
	<li>We don't use God to serve money</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>God wants to prosper people. Yes.</li>
	<li>But we should be careful on over emphasis on Prosperity. It turns people off. Jesus is more important than money</li>
	<li>With Jesus you are provided for and much more.</li>

<h3>7 Depiction / Characteristics of the Bride</h3>
<ol>
	<li>dove's eyes</li>
	<li>Hair</li>
	<li>Teeth</li>
	<li>Lips</li>
	<li>Mouth</li>
	<li>Temples</li>
</ol>
<h2>Head</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Its more about the Head part</li>
	<li>Reflection of the Christ who is the head of the Church</li>
	<li>The beauty we have is the reflection of His beauty</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>When Jesus first looks at us, He sees where we are looking ( looks at our eyes )
<ul>
	<li>Only when we see Jesus, then only He can see our eyes</li>
	<li>It's hard to look in to our eyes, when we are looking sideways or other side</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>First thing He look is your eyes
<ul>
	<li>He doesn't see you hands or feet</li>
	<li>He doesn't look at what we do with our hands</li>
	<li>He doesn't look at where we walk</li>
	<li>He doesn't look at whether they are good or bad</li>
	<li>It's not what we do</li>
	<li>It's not our walk</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Work is important and walk important but it will be done even without us knowing it ( sub consciously ) when we see unto Jesus</li>
	<li>We we look unto Jesus, it will affect what we do</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ending up doing good</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When the woman came with the Alabaster and anointed the feet of Jesus</li>
	<li>She had only eyes for Him</li>
	<li>It will affect your walk also</li>
	<li>She wasn't conscious of the work she was doing when she had her eyes on Jesus</li>
	<li>Her work were subconscious</li>
	<li>She has done good work</li>
	<li>A good work is born out of love.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mark 14:6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 But Jesus said, “Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>good work</strong> </span>for Me.
<h3>Looking beyond</h3>
<ul>
	<li>"behind your veil"</li>
	<li>veil is something that hides</li>
	<li>middle eastern , time of solomon</li>
	<li>Jesus is able to look beyond</li>
	<li>He is concerned about your eyes</li>
	<li>I can see the Holy Spirit dove in your eyes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dove</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Dove can find its home</li>
	<li>Dove has so long distance eyes</li>
	<li>Dove is so faithful</li>
	<li>Picture of Gentleness and peaceful</li>
	<li>The Lord saing "I see Gentleness in your eyes"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Peter Story</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus turned and looked at Peter</li>
	<li>Peter engaged with His eyes to Jesus eyes and so he wept.</li>
	<li>The Lord doesn't condemn us, The Lord loves us and thats what broke Peter's heart</li>
	<li>That made Peter jump in to the water and went towards Jesus</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>I see you beautiful <strong>now</strong></blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>More Goats --&gt; More Prosperity</li>
	<li>Plenty of Flocks, Goats and Cattle represent Prosperity, which was seen in Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
<ul>
	<li>That's how the wealth was measured at that time, as they don't have money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making love with words</h3>
<strong>Ephesians 5:23-27</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

23 For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. 24 Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.

25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, 26 that He might sanctify and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>cleanse her with the washing of water by the word</strong></span>, 27 that He might present her to <strong>Himself</strong> a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.
<ul>
	<li>People think that one day the church will be a glorious church</li>

Going down from Gilead.

And none is barren among them.

<h2>Come with me</h2>
<strong>Song of Solomon 4:8-11</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse,
With me from Lebanon.
Look from the top of Amana,
From the top of Senir and Hermon,
From the lions’ dens,
From the mountains of the leopards.
9 You have ravished my heart,
My sister, my spouse;
You have ravished my heart
With one look of your eyes,
With one link of your necklace.
10 How fair is your love,
My sister, my spouse!
How much better than wine is your love,
And the scent of your perfumes
Than all spices!
11 Your lips, O my spouse,
Drip as the honeycomb;
Honey and milk are under your tongue;
And the fragrance of your garments
Is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
<ul>
	<li>Sister : Jesus is our elder brother and our spouse</li>
	<li>Beautiful places : Lebanon, the top of Amana, top of Senir and Hermon,</li>
	<li>But there are dangerous things like lions’ dens and mountains of the leopards</li>
	<li>lions and leopards hunt sheep</li>
	<li>Love is better than wine ( yayin in Hebrew : http://biblehub.com/hebrew/3196.htm :  first time when Noah drunk wine , it intoxicated him )</li>
	<li>Honey and Milk : Land filled with milk and honey are under your tongue, in your words
<ul>
	<li>When you speak you enjoy your promise land</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Jesus is not saying , go away from that place , go other place, depart
<ul>
	<li>Depart , go away means, : I am here and you are there : makes a separation between God and us</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Jesus is not saying don't go near</li>
	<li>Jesus is saying, come with me. Thats the love of Chirst</li>
	<li>Come unto me I will give you rest</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Jesus saying to us, Come with me</blockquote>
<h3>First one in and last one out</h3>

<strong>The Great Flood</strong>

7 Then the Lord said to Noah, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Come into the ark</strong></span>, you and all your household, because I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation.
<ul>
	<li>Come into the ark means the Lord goes into the ark first</li>
	<li>He didn't say go</li>
	<li>He is not outside</li>
</ul>

	<li>First word a child learns is come ( Eg: Come to daddy )</li>
	<li>Grace is all about come</li>
	<li>Old Covenant : don't come near me</li>
</ul>
<h3>What ravishes the heart of Jesus?</h3>
With one look of our eyes,
With one link of our necklace
<ul>
	<li> Ravish is so powerful</li>
	<li>That much Jesus love us</li>
</ul>
<h3>Come</h3>
I Believe that the Book of revelation corresponds to the 22 letters of the hebrew alphabet
<ul>
	<li>2nd letter : Bet : Church is in Chapter 2</li>
	<li>5 : Grace : Redeems taking the scroll ( Worthy is the Lamp ) : chapter 5</li>
	<li>22 : Last letter tav : Jesus : Chapter 22</li>

Whoever <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>desires</strong></span>, let him take the water of life <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>freely</strong></span>.
