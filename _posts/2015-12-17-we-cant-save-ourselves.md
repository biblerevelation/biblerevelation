<ul>
	<li>We can't stop doing sins ourselves</li>
	<li>Jesus has to help us</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Sins</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Sin of Omission</li>
	<li>Sin of Commission</li>
	<li>Fear is a sin ( you fear because you don't believe in Christ : Disciples did this sin on the day of Jesus Resurrection. They are the first group of people who lead the way to Hell (In the Book of revelation) )</li>
</ul>
