<strong>Proverbs 16:21-24
New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 The wise in <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>heart</strong> </span>will be called prudent,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">sweetness</span> of the <span style="color: #0000ff;">lips</span> increases <span style="color: #0000ff;">learning</span></strong></span>.

22 Understanding is a wellspring of life to him who has it.
But the correction of fools is folly.

23 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>The heart of the wise teaches his mouth</strong></span>,
And adds <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>learning to his lips</strong></span>.

24 Pleasant <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>words</strong> </span>are like a honeycomb,
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Sweetness</strong></span> to the soul and health to the bones.
<ul>
	<li>Increase in Learning</li>
	<li>Sweetness to the soul</li>
	<li>Health to the bones</li>
</ul>
