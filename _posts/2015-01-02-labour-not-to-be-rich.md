<strong>Proverbs 23:4-5</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

4 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Labour not to be rich</strong></span>: cease from thine own wisdom.

5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
<h2>Do not overwork to be rich</h2>
<strong>Proverbs 23:4-5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 Will you set your eyes on that which is not?
For riches certainly make themselves wings;
They fly away like an eagle toward heaven.
<h2>What is of your own understanding?</h2>
