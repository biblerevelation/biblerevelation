<strong>Romans 10:14-17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Israel Rejects the Gospel</strong>

14 <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent?</strong></span> As it is written:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace,
Who bring glad tidings of good things!”</p>
16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” 17 So then <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God</span></strong>.
