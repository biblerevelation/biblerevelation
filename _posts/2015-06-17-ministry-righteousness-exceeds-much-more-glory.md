<strong>2 Corinthians 3:7-11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Glory of the New Covenant</strong>

7 But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away,
8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?
9 For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory</strong></span>. 10 For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels. 11 For if what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much more glorious.
