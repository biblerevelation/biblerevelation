<h3>Genesis 17</h3>
<h4><strong>First time All mighty God</strong></h4>
<strong>Genesis 17:1</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Sign of the Covenant</strong>

17 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Almighty God</strong> </span>(<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>El Shaddai</strong></span>); walk before Me and be blameless.

<strong>Genesis 15:5-6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 Then He brought him outside and said, “Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”

6 And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.

<strong>Genesis 16:1</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Hagar and Ishmae</strong>l

16 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Elyon : </strong></span>Supreme in position</li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Shaddai</strong> </span>: Absolute in power</li>
</ul>
<h4>Basis for the Gospel of Grace</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Mentioned in Romans and Galatians</li>
	<li>After mentioning El Elyon, God gave the revelation of How to be righteous by faith ( not by works or efforts )</li>
</ul>
<h3>More information</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Look now towards heaven and see if you are able to <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>count</strong> </span>the stars : *<strong><span style="color: #339966;">count</span> </strong>: re-count (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrew/5608.htm" target="_blank">http://biblehub.com/hebrew/5608.htm</a> )
<ul>
	<li>Psalms 19:1  : the heavens declare the glory of God ( declare = Saphar )</li>
	<li>Saphar = count : re-count</li>
	<li>see if you are able to saphar  ==&gt; see if you are able to tell the story
<ul>
	<li>12 constellations</li>
	<li>Adam and Abraham had more brain than our modern man ( they can understand the story about 12 constellations )</li>
	<li>12 Constellations: Starts with Vergo and ends with Leo</li>
	<li>Vergo: Vergin with a Baby ==&gt; Mathew opens up with a baby and the vergin</li>
	<li>Leo : New testament Ends with Lion with the trap of Judah</li>
	<li>12 Constellations points to the Gospel story long before there was bible.</li>
	<li>Adam, Noah, Abraham all know the bible story that a conqueror is going.</li>
	<li>Conqueror of the dragon : one of the constellation</li>
	<li>Abraham said, yes I can see the story. God said, yes that is your seed</li>
	<li>Abraham believe the same Gospel that you and I believe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Galatians : Sarah, Abraham's wife, a picture of Grace. Hagar : a picture of Law</li>
	<li>Grace and Faith are in the same ground. Sarah is Grace, Abraham is Faith</li>
	<li>God put Faith and Grace together</li>
	<li>Law and Faith are not same. They are Antithesis</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
