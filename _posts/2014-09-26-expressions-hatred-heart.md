<strong>Proverbs 26:23-26</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

23 Fervent lips with a wicked heart
Are like earthenware covered with silver dross.
24 He who hates, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>disguises it with his lips,</strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> And lays up deceit within himself</strong></span>;
25 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>When he speaks kindly, do not believe him</strong></span>,
For there are <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>seven abominations in his heart</strong></span>;
26 Though his hatred is covered by deceit,
His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.
