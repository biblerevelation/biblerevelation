<strong>Proverbs 19:2</strong>

2 Desire without knowledge is not good—
how <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>much more</strong> </span>will <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>hasty feet miss the way</strong></span>!

<strong>Proverbs 19:2</strong>
<strong>New International Version (NIV)</strong>

2 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Desire without knowledge is not good</strong></span>—
how much more will hasty feet miss the way!
<ul>
	<li>Desire without Knowledge is not good</li>
	<li>how much more will hasty feet miss the way</li>
</ul>
<strong>Proverbs 20:21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>An inheritance gained hastily</strong> </span>at the beginning
Will not be blessed at the end.

<strong>Proverbs 21:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The plans of the diligent lead surely to plenty</strong></span>,
But those of everyone who is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>hasty</strong></span>, surely to poverty.

<strong>Proverbs 15:16-17</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord</strong></span>,
Than great treasure with trouble.
17 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Better is</strong></span> a dinner of herbs <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>where love is</strong></span>,
Than a fatted calf with hatred.

<strong>Proverbs 16:8</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

8 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Better is a little with righteousness</strong></span>,
Than vast revenues without justice.

<strong>Proverbs 23:4-5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not overwork to be rich</strong></span>;
Because of your own understanding, cease!
5 Will you <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>set your eyes</strong></span> on that which is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>not</strong></span>?
For riches certainly make themselves wings;
They fly away like an eagle toward heaven.

<strong>Proverbs 24:27</strong>

Make it fit for yourself in the field;
And afterward build your house.

<strong>New Living Translation (NLT)</strong>
27 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do your planning and prepare your fields before building your house</strong></span>.

<h2>Decision Making</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Follow the Spirit</li>
	<li>Make decision when your inner most is calm ( eg: mud inside a cup of water : when mixed, you can't divide the soul and spirit : but when settled down, you can divide the soul and spirit )
<ul>
	<li>soul is you, spirit is where God dwells</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>No Substitute for waiting (calmness)</li>
