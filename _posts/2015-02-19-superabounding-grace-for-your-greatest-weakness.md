<h2>Superabounding Grace</h2>
<strong>Romans 5:20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded , grace abounded much more,

<strong>Romans 5:20</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>abounded <em>(pleonazo-increased)</em></strong></span>, grace did much more <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>abound <em>(huperperisseuo - superabounded)</em></strong></span>:
<ul>
	<li>huper is a preposition</li>
	<li>huper means super in English</li>
	<li>perisseuo = overflow</li>
	<li>E.g.: Natural , Supernatural. Overflowing, Super overflowing</li>
	<li>Where sin abounds, Grace super abounds</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 5:20</strong>
<strong>Kenneth Wuest ( Greek Scholar ) </strong>

"Where sin existed in abundance, grace was in super abundance, and some more added on top of that."

<strong>Romans 6:1-2</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>Dead to Sin, Alive to God</strong>

6 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? 2 Certainly not! How shall we who <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>died to sin</strong></span> live any longer in it?
<h3>Person who failed the most</h3>
<ul>
	<li>After resurrection</li>
	<li>Peter
<ul>
	<li>Most Ashamed</li>
	<li>Cried the most</li>
	<li>He felt that He can never be the same again</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Jesus gave instruction to Angels</li>
	<li>Among all disciples only Peter's name was mentioned. Why? Where sin increase, Grace super abounds.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mark 16:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 But go, tell His disciples—<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>and Peter</strong></span>—that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you.”
<ul>
	<li>"Feed my lamp"</li>
	<li>"Tan my sheep"</li>
	<li>"Feed my sheep"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus gave him responsibility of a pastor to take care of the flock</li>
	<li>Who denied knowing Jesus by cursing and swearing. Using the same mouth, now Peter was told to feed His lamp, tan His sheep and feed His sheep</li>
</ul>
Lamp : Baby Christians

Sheep : Older Christians
<ul>
	<li>We know that all other disciples were also feeding lamp, but Peter was given the special honour</li>
	<li>50 Days later on the day of pentecoste, Peter stood up and preached with the same mouth and 3000 people were saved</li>
</ul>
"Where (Location) sin increases, grace super abounds"

<strong>2 Corinthians 12:7-10</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Thorn in the Flesh</strong>

7 And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure.

8 Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me.

9 And He said to me, “My grace is <strong><span style="color: #808000;">sufficient <em>(strength to defend or ward off )</em></span></strong> for you, for <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>My strength <em>( dunamis - miracle working power )</em></strong> </span>is made <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>perfect <em>( show itself most effective )</em></strong></span> in weakness.” Therefore <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>most gladly</strong></span> I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>rest <em>(tabernacle/pitch a tent)</em></strong> </span>upon me.

10 Therefore <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I take pleasure</strong></span> in infirmities <em>(weaknesses)</em>, in reproaches <em>(insults)</em>, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses <em>(stress, Greek word: being pressured in to a narrow place)</em>, for Christ’s sake. For <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>when I am weak, then I am strong</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>The Thorn in the flesh means a messenger of Satan ( Its not disease in its context )</li>
	<li>the power of Christ may <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>rest</strong></span>(tabernacle/pitch a tent) upon me : God has pitch his Power over you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Problem could be with your day to day living</li>
	<li>Problem could be stress at work</li>
	<li>Problem could be a failure</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>My strength is not made perfect in strength</li>
	<li>My strength is not made perfect in talents</li>
	<li>But My strength is made perfect in weakness</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>You are never so strong as you are consciously week.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Person who think that they are really strong, their faith is there, they are flowing..etc . The Lord is saying that they are actually week.
<ul>
	<li>They are the brink of failure.</li>
	<li>They might use Gods name but they are Self confident.</li>
	<li>They have been believing the wrong things</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Most people are so positive. We don't have, but we pretend we have it.
<ul>
	<li>God hates hypocrisy</li>
	<li>God hates hypocrisy its because He loves hypocrites.</li>
	<li>Pretending to be what you are not</li>
	<li>Putting your best foot forward
<ul>
	<li>At this situation, when Lord loves you, we never feel loved</li>
	<li>Resulting in thinking that God doesn't loves us in our negative</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>E.g.: That's why the women of cannon
<ul>
	<li>asking Jesus for a miracle</li>
	<li>pretending to be a Jew</li>
	<li>Jesus was silent</li>
	<li>When she reveals her real identity and say "even dogs eat the crumbs that falls"
<ul>
	<li>Jesus immediately says, "great is your faith"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Jesus wants to come in your gutter and love you there,
<ul>
	<li>so that you really feel loved,</li>
	<li>when you really feel loved for who you are thats when His power is able to take you out of you gutter to upper most ( from the gutter most to the upper most )</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Its NOT thinking like
<ul>
	<li>Insults will be there</li>
	<li>Stress will be there</li>
	<li>Weakness will be there</li>
	<li>It's a part of life</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Doesn't mean that the power will come / power will manifest when we think like that</li>
	<li>If weakness alone will makes us strong, obviously the people were not strong</li>
	<li>See Paul, He rejoices for it, He praise God for it, He thank God for it</li>
	<li>E.g.:
<ul>
	<li>when some one insults you, At the moment say "Lord I am a candidate for the super abounding disproportionate Grace. I receive that now in Jesus name"</li>
	<li>This week I have a difficult exam, then say "Lord I thank you for the super abounding grace Lord"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Don't look back on what happened
<ul>
	<li>What happened is not God's will. Because it happened, now you are a candidate for a disproportionate grace like no other person has</li>
	<li>E.g.: Don't look back on what happened on miss carriage baby</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Abraham's Disproportionate Grace</h3>
Grace : Unmerited favour
<ul>
	<li>E.g.: Abraham was 99, Ishmael was 13, <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>He can no longer function</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li>Ishmael was born when Abraham was 86</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Genesis 17:1</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Almighty <em>(El Shaddai)</em></strong></span> God; walk before Me and be blameless.
<ul>
	<li>All these years Abraham know that God is Mighty God. When Abraham realised that <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>He cannot produce a child anymore</strong></span>, God says I am Almighty God</li>
	<li>First time Almighty God is used</li>
	<li>El Shaddai means All supplying one, Almighty God</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disproportionate Grace Example</h3>
Example: Loosing a child years ago
<ul>
	<li>Don't look back on what happened</li>
	<li>What happened is not God's will. Because it happened, now you are a candidate for a disproportionate grace for a baby like no other person has</li>
</ul>
Your friends could have babies. But the one that receives Gods supernatural grace, Because you have challenge in that area, you will produce a baby has this
<ul>
	<li>Extraordinary Quality,</li>
	<li>X factor,</li>
	<li>Karisma,</li>
	<li>The favour of God</li>
</ul>
Like no other babies put together
<h2>Apostle Paul's climax of all he was sharing about Grace</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Shouted to the Highest Heaven and Lowest Hell</li>
	<li>In Romans 8</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 8:32-37</strong>
<strong>King James Version (KJV)</strong>

32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall <strong>tribulation</strong>, or <strong>distress</strong>, or <strong>persecution</strong>, or <strong>famine</strong>, or <strong>nakedness</strong>, or <strong>peril</strong>, or <strong>sword</strong>?
36 As it is written, For thy sake <strong>we are killed all the day long</strong>; <strong>we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter</strong>.
37 Nay, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>in all these things</strong></span> we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

<strong>Footnotes:</strong>

Romans 8:36 Psalm 44:22
<h3><strong>Negatives in life <em><span style="color: #ff00ff;">( in all these things )</span></em></strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Tribulation</li>
	<li>Distress</li>
	<li>Persecution</li>
	<li>Famine</li>
	<li>Nakeness</li>
	<li>Peril</li>
	<li>Sword</li>
</ul>
<strong>Looks like</strong>
<ul>
	<li>we are killed all the day long</li>
	<li>we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paul's Answer for above negative things</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Nay, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>in all these things</strong></span> we are more than conquerors through him that loved us</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We are not saying, sin that grace may abound</li>
	<li>We are saying that life is such that just by your mere existence you are bound to fail here and there and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>its about how you view you failures</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Our View towards sin</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Many people are still bound by the past, "I wish I should not have done that"</li>
	<li>Or if something bad happens, they will say that this happened because of the things which i did some time ago , thats how we view sin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gods view towards sin</h3>
Lets see how God views it
<ul>
	<li>God punishes sin in the Body of Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>God cannot spare sin</li>
	<li>Sin mush be punished otherwise God is not holy, God is not Just</li>
	<li>God punishes all our sins in the body of Jesus Christ, thats how much God loves us</li>
</ul>
<h3>Is that's all there is to it?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Because of the Cross, When Jesus Christ cried one word "Finished"
<ul>
	<li>All the doors of Heaven that was closed, flunk open</li>
	<li>Every door of blessing flunk open</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The separation of the veil between God and man was torn us under</li>
	<li>The same blood that tore the veil removed our sins for all of us to come in boldly</li>
	<li>God looks at us with no sin on us, not that there is no sin in us,</li>
	<li>God looks at us with no sin on us Because His Son has removed all our sins</li>
	<li>And we can stand before God boldly. This is what Jesus Christ has done for us.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens to our sin then?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Something else happened</li>
	<li>One door is open</li>
	<li>God says "Where ever there is sin in your life, my superabounding grace and more on top of that will flow in to the area of your life"</li>
</ul>
