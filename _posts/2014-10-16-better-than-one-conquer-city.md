<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty,
And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.

Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city.

<strong>New Living Translation</strong>
Better to be patient than powerful; better to have self-control than to conquer a city.

<strong>English Standard Version</strong>
Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.

<strong>New American Standard Bible</strong>
He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, And he who rules his spirit, than he who captures a city.

He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
