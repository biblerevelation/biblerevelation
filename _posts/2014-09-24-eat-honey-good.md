<strong>Proverbs 24:13-14</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

13 My son, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>eat honey because it is good</strong></span>,
And the honeycomb which is sweet to your taste;
14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul;
If you have found it, there is a prospect,
And your hope will not be cut off.

<strong>Proverbs 25:16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 Have you found honey?
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Eat only as much as you need</strong></span>,
Lest you be filled with it and vomit.

<strong>Proverbs 25:27</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

27 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>It is not good to eat much honey</strong></span>;
So to seek oneâ€™s own glory is not glory.
