<ul>
	<li>When you have a toothache,Â will you think about the missionary in the village?</li>
	<li>When you have a headache, are you short tempered?</li>
	<li>When you are sick, are you focusing on yourself?</li>
	<li>When you are not feeling well, are you a disturbance to others?</li>
</ul>
Yes.

So let's not blame others
<ul>
	<li>When you are Christ centered, you won't have any diseases and you will be removed from selfishness.</li>
</ul>
