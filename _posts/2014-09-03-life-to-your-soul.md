<strong>Proverbs 3:21-26</strong>
New King James Version (NKJV)

21 My son, let them not depart from your eyesâ€”
Keep sound wisdom and discretion;
22 So they will be <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>life to your soul</strong></span>
And grace to your neck.
23 Then <span style="color: #008000;">you will walk safely</span> in your way,
And <span style="color: #008000;">your foot will not stumble</span>.
24 When you lie down, <span style="color: #008000;">you will not be afraid</span>;
Yes, you will lie down and <span style="color: #008000;">your sleep will be sweet</span>.
25 Do not be afraid of sudden terror,
Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes;
26 For the Lord will be your confidence,
And will keep your foot from being caught.
