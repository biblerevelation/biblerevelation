Sometime we have this idea that God is stern and Jesus is wonderful, but its wrong.

<strong>John 3:16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

16 For <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>God so loved the world</strong></span> that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
<ul>
	<li>God so loved the world</li>
	<li>He gave His only begotten Son</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 4:5</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 But to him who does not work but <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>believes on Him</strong></span> who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness,
<ul>
	<li>believes on God</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 4:24</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>believe in Him</strong></span> who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,
<ul>
	<li>believe in Him</li>
	<li>He raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead</li>
	<li>If we are to stand before Him, as He is God we are finished</li>
	<li>But we stand before Him as a Saviour God</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>He is a Saviour God</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>If we are to stand before Him as He is God alone, we will beÂ finished</li>
	<li>But we stand before Him as Saviour God and He is our Father</li>
</ul>
