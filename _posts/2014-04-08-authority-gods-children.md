<h3>Matthew 18:18</h3>
New International Version (NIV)

</div>
<div>

18 “Truly I tell you, whatever you <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #9a48b7;"><strong>bind</strong></span> on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #9a48b7;"><strong>loose</strong></span> on earth will be loosed in heaven.
<ul>
	<li>Binding "<strong>on earth</strong>" comes first and then comes heaven</li>
	<li>Loose "<strong>on earth</strong>" comes first and then comes heaven</li>
	<li>First it happens in earth and then heaven</li>
</ul>
<h2>WHO IS IN EARTH?</h2>
GOD'S Children's, We.
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">As we are "<span style="color: #9a48b7;">Ambassadors of Christ</span>"</span></strong></li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">God making His appeal as it were through us</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>So,</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bind</strong> all the demons,</li>
	<li><strong>Loose</strong> all the Knots : Problems,</li>
	<li>Heal the sick,</li>
	<li>Calm the storm,</li>
	<li>Stop the earthquake on happening</li>
</ul>
So please don't blame God for earthquakes and Storms. Being God's ambassador, You have the responsibility to calm the storm and stop earthquakes.

<h3>2 Corinthians 5:20</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>20 So <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>we are Christ’s ambassadors, God making His appeal as it were through us</strong></span>. We [as Christ’s personal representatives] beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [now offered you] and be reconciled to God.</blockquote>
