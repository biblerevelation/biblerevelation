<h2>Jesus Curses a fig tree</h2>
<h2>Fig Tree represents Self Righteousness</h2>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">It started in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Even took Fig leaves to cover their nakedness, once after they sin</li>
	<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Jesus curses a fig tree</li>
	<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">All sinners received healing from Jesus, except pharisees and Sadducees who believed on Self righteousness by keeping the commandments / law</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to find out if it had any fruit. When He reached it, He found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">14 Then He said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">*He = Jesus</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Jesus Answered "Have faith in God"</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff00ff;">Peter said to Jesus "the fig tree You cursed has withered"</span>
<ul>
	<li>Fig Tree represents, Have faith in yourself --&gt; Self Righteousness</li>
	<li>Jesus Answered, Have faith in God --&gt; His Righteousness</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Answer</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.0909090909; font-style: inherit;">After cursing Fig Tree Jesus Carried on explaining about Faith</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.0909090909; font-style: inherit;">So the starting stage of having faith is cursing the fig tree , i.e. cursing the self righteousness </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Examples Showing your self righteousness</span></h2>
All these below statements <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">proves</span></span> that you are trying to be self righteous
<ul>
	<li>I pray for 1 hour each day, but i couldn't see any miracles</li>
	<li>I read bible 2 hours each day, but i couldn't see any miracles</li>
	<li>I obey to God's words, but i couldn't see any miracles</li>
	<li>I help others, but i couldn't see any miracles</li>
	<li>I pray for others, but i couldn't see any miracles</li>
	<li>I go church regularly, but i couldn't see any miracles</li>
	<li><span style="font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.5;">I serve God and do His ministry, but i couldn’t see any miracles</span></li>
</ul>
All these above phrases are
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">ALL ABOUT YOU</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">ALL ABOUT HOW PERFECT YOU ARE</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">ALL ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU ARE</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">NOTHING IS ABOUT JESUS and HIS LOVE TOWARDS YOU and HOW GOOD HE IS</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> </span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">It doesn't mean</span> that you should not do all above phrases, but the fact is
<ul>
	<li>THEY ARE NOT THE ROOT, THEY ARE THE FRUITS,</li>
	<li>THEY ARE NOT THE THINGS WHICH YOU SHOULD RELY ON TO RECEIVE MIRACLES</li>
</ul>
