<strong>Hebrews 9:22</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22 And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.

<strong>Romans 3:21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<strong> God’s Righteousness Through Faith</strong>

21 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>But now</strong></span> the righteousness of God <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>apart</strong></span> from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>But now</strong></span>, : there was a time when they didn't receive the righteousness of God</li>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>apart</strong> </span>: righteousness of God is different from law</li>
</ul>
<strong>Romans 5:17</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>receive</strong></span> <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>abundance of grace</strong></span> and of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the gift of righteousness</strong></span> shall <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>reign in life</strong></span> by one, Jesus Christ.)
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>receive</strong></span> : constant receiving ( active tense )</li>
	<li><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>reign in life</strong></span> : reign in everything ( workplace, addiction, health..)</li>
	<li>Even if you are sick don't call that sickness.</li>
	<li>God is a God who calls those things that are not as though they are and then they are</li>
	<li>God saw darkness and said "Light be" and Light came</li>
	<li>God saw a sea without creature and God said "let the sea bring-forth wales, fishes.. " and there they were.</li>
	<li>God made us in His image</li>
	<li>So whatever you want, speak it and you will see it ( this is called faith )</li>
	<li>Man is so fallen that he has to see before he speaks</li>
	<li>God said " you will have what you say "</li>
	<li>So when man sees dark, he says "wow, so dark", then it becomes darker</li>
	<li>Because man is living in a place of non faith.</li>
	<li>Place of faith is to walk like God and talk like God.</li>
	<li>God saw Gideon who was trembling , an angel appeared and said " mighty man of valor!"</li>
	<li>Man saw a shepherd boy, but God called him a king</li>
	<li>Jesus saw Simon. Simon means "<a title="Read/Hearing/Listen" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Simon.html" target="_blank">read/hearing/listen</a>..". Jesus called his as Petros ( Peter ). You shall be a rock. Finally he end-up becoming a rock/pillar for the church.</li>
	<li>God doesn't see who you are in natural. He sees your potential and destiny by which he called you to.</li>
	<li>We are definitely not an accident.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Judges 6:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said to him, “The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor!”

<strong>John 1:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
