<strong>Proverbs 22:26-27</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

26 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Do not be one of those who shakes hands in a pledge</strong></span>,
One of those who is <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>surety for debts</strong></span>;
27 If you have nothing with which to pay,
Why should he take away your bed from under you?

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SURELY FOR DEBTS</strong></span>
