<strong>Proverbs 18:20</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 A man’s stomach shall be satisfied from <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>the fruit of his mouth</strong></span>;
From the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>produce of his lips</strong></span> he shall be <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">filled</span></strong>.
