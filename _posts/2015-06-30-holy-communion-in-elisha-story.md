<h2>Elisha Purifies the Pot of Stew</h2>
<strong>2 Kings 4:38-41</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text 2Kgs-4-38"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>And Elisha returned to Gilgal, and <i>there was</i> a famine in the land. Now the sons of the prophets <i>were</i> sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.” </span> <span id="en-NKJV-9643" class="text 2Kgs-4-39"><sup class="versenum">39 </sup>So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced <i>them</i> into the pot of stew, though they did not know <i>what they were.</i> </span> <span id="en-NKJV-9644" class="text 2Kgs-4-40"><sup class="versenum">40 </sup>Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, “Man of God, <i>there is</i> death in the pot!” And they could not eat <i>it.</i></span>

<span id="en-NKJV-9645" class="text 2Kgs-4-41"><sup class="versenum">41 </sup>So he said, “Then bring some flour.” And he put <i>it</i> into the pot, and said, “Serve <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</span>
<h3>Flour, Picture of Jesus</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Mans Idea: clean by removing</li>
	<li>Gods Idea: Clean by Adding ( Adding Jesus )</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Add Jesus to any situation to clean, to heal, to solve, to restore</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>People who touch leper(unclean), leprosy(uncleanness) will stick on to them</li>
	<li>But when Jesus touch a leper(unclean), His own cleanness swallows the leprosy. Because His own cleanness was bigger than any uncleanness.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="en-NKJV-9646" class="text 2Kgs-4-42">Elisha Feeds One Hundred Men</span></h2>
<strong>2 Kings 4:42-44</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text 2Kgs-4-42"><sup class="versenum">42 </sup><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Then</strong> </span>a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>firstfruits</strong></span>, twenty loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, “Give <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-9647" class="text 2Kgs-4-43"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>But his servant said, “What? Shall I set this before one hundred men?”</span>

<span class="text 2Kgs-4-43">He said again, “Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>: ‘They shall eat and have <i>some</i> left over.’” </span> <span id="en-NKJV-9648" class="text 2Kgs-4-44"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>So he set <i>it</i> before them; and they ate and had <i>some</i> left over, according to the word of the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Bread</strong></span> of the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>firstfruits</strong></span></li>
</ul>
