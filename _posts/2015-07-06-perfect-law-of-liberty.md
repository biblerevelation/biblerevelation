<strong>James 1:25</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-30292" class="text Jas-1-25"><sup class="versenum">25Â </sup>But he who looks into the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>perfect law of liberty</strong></span> and continues <i>in it,</i> and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.</span>
