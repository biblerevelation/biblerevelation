<ul>
 	<li>The joy of you is NOT your strength</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Nehemiah 8:10
</span><span class="passage-display-version">World English Bible (WEB)</span></strong>

<span id="en-WEB-12504" class="text Neh-8-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing is prepared; for today is holy to our Lord. Don’t be grieved; for <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>the joy of Yahweh (the Lord ) is your strength</strong></span>.”</span>
<h2><strong>What the Lord rejoices in?</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Zephaniah 3:17
</span><span class="passage-display-version">World English Bible (WEB)</span></strong>

<span id="en-WEB-22838" class="text Zeph-3-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Yahweh ( The Lord ), your God, is among you, a mighty one who will save. <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>He will rejoice over you</strong></span> with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.</span>
<ul>
 	<li>If you know He rejoices over you, you will have strength</li>
 	<li>If you know you are God's beloved, you will have strength</li>
 	<li>"He is my beloved, in whom I am well pleased" - the Father to the Son Jesus
<ul>
 	<li>Then the ministry of Jesus got started and Jesus conquered death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
