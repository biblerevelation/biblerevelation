<strong>Proverbs 23:15-16</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 My son, if your heart is wise,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>My heart will rejoice</strong></span>â€”<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>indeed</strong></span>, I myself;
16 Yes, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>my inmost being will rejoice</strong></span>
When your lips speak right things.

<strong>Proverbs 23:22-25</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22 Listen to your <strong>father</strong> who begot you,
And do not despise your <strong>mother</strong> when she is old.
23 Buy the truth, and do not sell it,
Also wisdom and instruction and understanding.
24 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice</strong></span>,
And he who begets a wise child will delight in him.
25 Let your <strong>father</strong> and your <strong>mother</strong> be glad,
And let her who bore you rejoice.
