<h2>Will we die in this World  as per Bible ?</h2>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Jesus the bread of Life</span></h2>
<strong>John 6:48-51 King James Version (KJV)</strong>

48 I am that bread of life.
49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><b>dead*</b></span>.
50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><b>live for ever*</b></span>: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>*dead</strong></span> --&gt; Physical Death
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>*live for ever</strong> </span>--&gt; Physical Life

In the Original language it's called <strong>"zuvi"</strong>, which means <strong>"worldly live for ever"</strong>

<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>by Holy Communion  : Lord's supper</strong></span>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b style="color: #404040; text-decoration: underline;">2. Power of Becoming New Creation on Earth</b></span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>  King James Version (KJV)
17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>#old things are passed away</strong></span>; behold, all things are become new.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Revelation 21:4</span>  King James Version (KJV)
4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> #former things are passed away</strong></span>.
<h3><strong>What are Old things/Former things?</strong></h3>
Bible Interprets Bible

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff00ff;">Former things : Old things</span>
1. Death
2. Sorrow
3. Crying
4. Pain

You become a new creation by <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>#BAPTISM</strong></span>
You are #IN Christ through <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>#BAPTISM</strong></span>

<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Old thing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">death</span> have passed away</strong></span>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Story of Adam and Eve</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>God didn't create Adam and Eve to die</li>
	<li>There was no death in the Garden of Eden</li>
	<li>Death only came because of man's sin</li>
	<li>Jesus conquered death</li>
	<li>Jesus died for all our sins and He made us Righteous and He made us reign over death</li>
</ul>
<div class="heading passage-class-0" style="color: #5c1101;">
<h3>Romans 5:17</h3>
<p class="txt-sm">New King James Version (NKJV)</p>

</div>
<div class="passage version-NKJV result-text-style-normal text-html " style="color: #000000;">
<blockquote><span id="en-NKJV-28065" class="text Rom-5-17"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">17 </span>For if by the one man’s offense <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>death reigned</strong></span> through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>reign in life</strong></span> through the One, Jesus Christ.)</span></blockquote>
By First Adam's offence, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>death</strong></span> reigned

By Last Adam (Jesus), <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>life</strong></span> reigns
<ul>
	<li>Previously, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>death Reigned</strong></span> over life</li>
	<li>Now by Jesus Christ, <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Life Reign</span></strong> over death</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>
<h3><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="color: #800000;">How sin entered the world</span> : by eating ( fruit in Garden of Eden)</span></h3>
</li>
	<li>
<h3><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="color: #800000;">How God is reversing the process</span> : by eating ( Holy Communion )</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
So the more and more we remember the death of Jesus for our sin by Holy Communion, the more we live death free, pain free, sorrow free life.
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Resurrection is here NOW</span></h2>

<h3>John 11:20-27</h3>
Amplified Bible (AMP)

<div>
<blockquote>20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet Him, while Mary remained sitting in the house.

21 Martha then said to Jesus, Master, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.

22 And even now I know that whatever You ask from God, He will grant it to You.

23 Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.

24 Martha replied, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the <span style="color: #ff6600;">last day</span>.

25 Jesus said to her, I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life. <span style="color: #008000;">Whoever believes in (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on) Me, although he may die, yet he shall live</span>;

26 And<span style="color: #af50ab;"> whoever continues to live and believes in (has faith in, cleaves to, and relies on) Me shall never [actually] die at all</span>. Do you believe this?

27 She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed [I do believe] that You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One), the Son of God, [even He] Who was to come into the world. [It is for Your coming that the world has waited.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>24 Martha replied, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">last day</span>.

25a Jesus said to her, I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life.</blockquote>
<h2>Resurrection is Here NOW:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>From the above verse, It's very clear that this resurrection and death conversation things which would happen before the <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">end of the world</span></span></li>
	<li>Thus It's very clear that this conversation is all about Worldly death, worldly resurrection and worldly living forever.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life</li>
	<li>Jesus is the Resurrection and the Life</li>

<h3>1 Corinthians 15:51-52</h3>
<p class="txt-sm">New King James Version (NKJV)</p>

</div>
<div class="passage version-NKJV result-text-style-normal text-html ">

<span id="en-NKJV-28770" class="text 1Cor-15-51"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">51 </span>Behold, I tell you a <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">mystery*</span></strong>: <span style="color: #000000;">We shall </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>not all sleep*</strong></span>, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff; text-decoration: underline;">we shall all be changed</span></strong></span>— </span>

<span id="en-NKJV-28771" class="text 1Cor-15-52"><span class="versenum" style="font-weight: bold;">52 </span>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>we shall be changed</strong></span>.</span>

<strong><span style="color: #339966;">*not all sleep</span></strong> =&gt; Not everyone will die

<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>*mystery</strong></span> =&gt; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">means</span> Not everyone knows, not everyone can understand

( <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">everyone knows</span></strong> that only the people who were born/living during when Jesus second coming shall go directly to heaven,</em>

<em>but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not everyone</strong></span> knows that there are even people who will live death free life for 100's of years : <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>That't why its "mystery" </strong></span></em>)
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. So what about "For dust you are, And to dust you shall return"?</span></h2>
<strong>Answer:</strong>
<h3>Did we die before?</h3>
Yes!! During Baptism.

<b>Colossians 3:3</b>

New King James Version (NKJV)

3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For you died</strong></span>, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.

<b>Romans 6:3-11</b>

New King James Version (NKJV)

3 Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?

4 Therefore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we were buried with Him through baptism into death</strong></span>, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

<h2>Answer</h2>
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>As per Bible, those who are in Christ Jesus won't die.</strong></span></h2>
But Why People die?
<ul>
	<li>Either they are not in Christ Jesus (People who don't believe Christ died for us and He already died for our sins)</li>
	<li>Or People don't have understanding of Christ Jesus</li>
	<li>Or <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>People might receive Christ, but they might mix both Old Testament and New Testament ( eg: old vine in to new vine skin, either be warm or be cold )</strong></span></li>
