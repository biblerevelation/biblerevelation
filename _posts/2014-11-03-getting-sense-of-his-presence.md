<h2><strong>Getting back the sense of His presence</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Find somebody to talk to , about the beauty of the Lord</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Song of Solomon 5:9-13</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h3>The Daughters of Jerusalem</h3>
9 What is your beloved
More than another beloved,
O fairest among women?
What is your beloved
More than another beloved,
That you so charge us?
<h3>The Shulamite</h3>
10 My beloved is white and ruddy,
Chief among ten thousand.
11 His head is like the finest gold;
His locks are wavy,
And black as a raven.
12 His eyes are like doves
By the rivers of waters,
Washed with milk,
And fitly set.
13 His cheeks are like a bed of spices,
Banks of scented herbs.
His lips are lilies,
Dripping liquid myrrh.
<ul>
	<li>white and ruddy = Full God and Full Man</li>
	<li>His eyes are like doves = Eyes that saw peter</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to show others the sense of God's love?</h2>
<strong>Song of Solomon 6:1</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h3>The Daughters of Jerusalem</h3>
6 Where has your beloved gone,
O fairest among women?
Where has your beloved turned aside,
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>That we may seek him with you</strong></span>?
