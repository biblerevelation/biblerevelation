<strong>Proverbs 9:7-8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 â€œ<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who corrects a scoffer gets shame</strong></span> for himself,
And he who rebukes a wicked man only harms himself.
8 Do not correct a scoffer, lest <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>he hate you</strong></span>;
Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
