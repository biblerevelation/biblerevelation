<strong>What, the women with the issue of blood heard about Jesus?</strong>

<strong>Mark 5:27-29</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

27 When <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>she heard</strong></span> about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment. 28 For she said, “If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.”

29 Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction.
<h2>What she heard?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Whatever she heard could be a testimonial.
<ul>
	<li>Something good about Jesus, which increased her faith.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>That small faith made her to come behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment.</li>
	<li>She was instantly healed of the affliction.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: right;"><strong>The more and more you hear about the Goodness of Jesus, you will start receiving healing. </strong></h3>
