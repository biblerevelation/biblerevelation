<h2>Daniel</h2>
<strong>Daniel 6:14-24</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 And the king, when he heard these words, was greatly displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him. 15 Then these men approached the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”

16 So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. But the king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.” 17 Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signets of his lords, that the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed.
<h3>Daniel Saved from the Lions</h3>
18 Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no musicians[a] were brought before him. Also his sleep went from him. 19 Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. 20 And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel. The king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”

21 Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! 22 My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.”

23 Now the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he believed in his God.
<h3>Darius Honors God</h3>
24 And the king gave the command, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den.
<h3>Will not be punished the Second Time</h3>
<strong>Acts 10:15</strong>
<strong> New International Version (NIV)</strong>

15 The voice spoke to him a second time, “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.”

<strong>Nahum 1:9</strong>
<strong> King James Version (KJV)</strong>

9 What do ye imagine against the Lord? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.
