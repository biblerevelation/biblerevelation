<h2>House of Solomon</h2>
<strong>1 Kings 6:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 And the temple, when it was being built, was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built.
<ul>
	<li>There was no human effort.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Living Stone</h2>
<strong>1 Peter 2:4-10</strong>
<strong> New International Version (NIV)</strong>

<strong>The Living Stone and a Chosen People</strong>

4 As you come to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>him, the living Stone</strong></span>—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him— 5 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>you also, like living stones</strong></span>, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 6 For in Scripture it says:

“See, I lay a stone in Zion,
a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>chosen and precious cornerstone</strong></span>,
and the one who trusts in him
will never be put to shame.”
7 Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe,

“The stone the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone,”
8 and,

“A stone that causes people to stumble
and a rock that makes them fall.”
They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for.

9 But <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>you are a chosen people</strong></span>, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light</strong></span>. 10 Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
<ul>
	<li>Jesus is the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>chosen and precious corner stone</strong></span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is living stone?</h3>
Shaped stone, brought out of darkness, made for a purpose.
<ul>
	<li>We became living stone through Christ</li>
	<li>We were in darkness before making us as a living stone</li>
	<li>Jesus brought us out of darkness</li>
</ul>
<h2>I will make him a pillar</h2>
<strong>Revelation 3:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God</strong></span>, and he shall go out no more. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God. And I will write on him My new name.
<h2>Bronze pillars cast in clay moulds</h2>
<h3>We are moulded to be more precious</h3>
<strong>1 Kings 7:9-12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

9 All these were of costly stones cut to size, trimmed with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the eaves, and also on the outside to the great court. 10 The foundation was of costly stones, large stones, some ten cubits and some eight cubits. 11 And above were costly stones, hewn to size, and cedar wood. 12 The great court was enclosed with three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams. So were the inner court of the house of the Lord and the vestibule of the temple.

<strong>1 Kings 7:21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 Then he set up the pillars by the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Jachin</strong></span>, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Boaz</strong></span>.

<strong>1 Kings 7:45-47</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

45 the pots, the shovels, and the bowls.

All these articles which Huram made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord were of burnished bronze. 46 In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and Zaretan. 47 And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
<ul>
	<li>Bronze pillars cast in clay moulds
<ul>
	<li>Clay represents earthen vessel.</li>
	<li>God uses people to cut all the rough places</li>
	<li>Especially when you are married</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>All people are not stones</li>
	<li>Some people become pillars of bronze.</li>
	<li>Eg: more you mould gold, it would become more pure and it will become more costly. ( scum comes out when it's in high heat )</li>
	<li>Pillar is not for everybody</li>
	<li>God wants to make you the vessel of honour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vessel of Honour</h2>
<strong>2 Timothy 2:20-21</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor. 21 Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.

<strong>Romans 9:21-23</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

21 Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?

22 What if God, wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, 23 and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory,
<h2>Paul mentioned some pillars</h2>
<strong>Galatians 2:9</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

9 and when <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars</strong></span>, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
<h2>The real beauty</h2>
<h3>Gold</h3>
<strong>Song of Solomon 5:11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 His head is like the finest gold;
His locks are wavy,
And black as a raven.

<strong>Song of Solomon 5:14-15</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

14 His hands are rods of gold
Set with beryl.
His body is carved ivory
Inlaid with sapphires.
15 His legs are pillars of marble
Set on bases of fine gold.
His countenance is like Lebanon,
Excellent as the cedars.
<h3>Eyes of Jesus</h3>
<strong>Song of Solomon 4:1</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The Bridegroom Praises the Bride</strong>
<strong> The Beloved</strong>

4 Behold, you are fair, my love!
Behold, you are fair!
You have dove’s eyes behind your veil.
Your hair is like a flock of goats,
Going down from Mount Gilead.
<h2>Story of Peter</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Andrew and John were disciples of John the Baptist</li>
	<li>John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</strong></span></li>
	<li>The two disciples heard John the Baptist speak, and they followed Jesus</li>
	<li>Andrew found where Jesus dwelt</li>
	<li>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother said to him, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>We have found the Messiah</strong></span>”</li>
	<li>Andrew brought Simon Peter to Jesus</li>
	<li>Jesus looked at Simon, He said, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas</strong></span>”</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Lamb of God</h3>
<div></div>
<strong>John 1:29</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</strong></span>

<strong>John 1:35-42</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<strong>The First Disciples</strong>

35 Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. 36 And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Behold the Lamb of God!</strong></span>”

37 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus</strong></span>. 38 Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, “What do you seek?”

They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), “where are You staying?”

39 He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).

40 One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 41 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>We have found the Messiah</strong></span>” (which is translated, the Christ). 42 And he brought him to Jesus.

Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas</strong></span>” (which is translated, A Stone).
<ul>
	<li>Cephas is aramaic for Stone ( stone also called rock )</li>
	<li>Cephar in English, ( Peter )</li>
	<li>Simon means Hearing</li>
	<li>Peter was converted but not consecrated ( It is Possible for anyone to be converted but not consecrated )</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cast out your NetS</h3>
<h4>Jesus cultivated Peter</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Crowd pressed Jesus</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Where the word of God was preached, people would press to hear</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>There were two boats</li>
	<li>Jesus stepped in to the one which belongs to Simon</li>
	<li>Jesus told Peter to let down the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>NetS ( Plural )</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Jesus is setting us up to bless us, if Jesus asks for a favour</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Peter cast out his <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>NET ( Singular )</strong></span></li>
	<li>Good food all in the word of God</li>
	<li>Jesus is the bread of life</li>
	<li>Eat the bread of life and get nourished</li>
	<li>Bread outside is not going to help you</li>
	<li>Bread inside is going to help you.</li>
	<li>Making of Bread
<ul>
	<li>Broken, Crushed, Smashed, burned</li>
	<li>Jesus was broken, crushes, smashed, burned</li>
	<li>Jesus gave His body for us to eat and be nourished</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Goodness of God leads us to repentance.
<h3>Jesus went in to Peter's House</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Right after the synagogue experience</li>
	<li>After some days</li>
	<li>Jesus went right in to Peter's House</li>
	<li>Peter's mother in law was sick</li>
	<li>Jesus rebuked the fever
<ul>
	<li>Fever is not from God</li>
	<li>Rebuke Fever</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Peters Mother in law and Wife could have been made satisfied of Peter going with Jesus, because of this incident.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jesus walking on water</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus would have send the disciples first, then He left the multitude and He walked up in the mountain
<ul>
	<li>Picture of Jesus being in the Fathers right hand.</li>
	<li>This happened after Jesus fed 5000 men and women and children.</li>
	<li>This happened after the People wanted Him to be the king. So He departed from them.
<ul>
	<li>Jesus came to save us</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Jesus would have seen from the top of mountain, that they have travelled only 3 miles because of the boisterous wind.</li>
	<li>Distance of travel = 10 miles</li>
	<li>After 9 Hours, the Disciples have travelled only 3 miles because of the boisterous winds</li>
	<li>4'th watch is the darkest hour ( 3 am to 6 am )
<ul>
	<li>Jesus will come and help you in the darkest hour</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Lake of Galilee is the lowest lake on earth
<ul>
	<li>Jesus will come and help you when you are the lowest place</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>As long as Peter behold Jesus, He was above waters, supernaturally
<ul>
	<li>We could be supernatural not because of what we have done, what we have prayed, what we have fasted, how much we have prayed, how much we have fasted............... <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>It's all about beholding Jesus</strong></span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>While walking in water,<strong> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Peter might not be even near Jesus</span></strong>, but as soon as Peter started sinking inside water, Jesus immediately hold his hands.
<ul>
	<li>If Peter would have been near Jesus, Peter would have tried holding on to Jesus</li>
	<li>But Peter could be a bit far, So Jesus has to come near Peter in an instance of a second, because sinking in water could be a second. ( It wont take 1 min to sink. Sinking inside water is instant as you could see when you throw a stone inside water )</li>
	<li>It's not about us holding on to Jesus with our weak hands</li>
	<li>It's about Jesus holding us with His strong hands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Jesus taught Peter step by step.</li>
	<li>As soon as Jesus stepped in to the boat, Immediately the boat reached the shore.
<ul>
	<li>Around 7 Miles covered in an instant.</li>
	<li>Teleportation in Jesus time</li>

<h4>The Lord rides the flood, by Psalmist</h4>
<strong>Psalm 66:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

12 You have caused men to ride over our heads;
We went through fire and through water;
But You brought us out to rich fulfillment.

<strong> Psalm 29:10</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

10 The Lord sat enthroned at the Flood,
And the Lord sits as King forever.
<h3>At the foot of Mount of Transfiguration</h3>
<strong>Matthew 16:13-23</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h4>Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</h4>
13 When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, “Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”

14 So they said, “Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”

15 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”

16 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Simon Peter answered</strong></span> and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

17 Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. 18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 19 And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed[a] in heaven.”

20 Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.
<h4>Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection</h4>
21 From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.

22 Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!”

23 But He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.”

<strong>Mark 8:32-33</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

32 He spoke this word openly. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. 33 But when <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>He had turned around and looked at His disciples</strong></span>, He rebuked Peter, saying, “Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.”
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">He had turned around and looked at His disciples</span> : </strong>meant to say, if I don't die for your sins, how to save these disciples?</li>
	<li>Jesus could step into heaven at any time, as he fulfilled Exodus 20. But Jesus died for us to save us</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mount of Transfiguration</h3>
<strong>Matthew 17:3-8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. 4 Then <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Peter answered</strong></span> and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”

5 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>While he was still speaking</strong></span>, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!” 6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid. 7 But Jesus came and touched them and said, “Arise, and do not be afraid.” 8 When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Jesus only</span></strong>.
<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>While he was still speaking </strong></span>implies, God was not pleased on what Peter said ( Keeping Moses (Law) , Elijah (Prophet), and Jesus on the same ground )</li>
	<li>"Hear Him!", not them</li>
	<li>Jesus first words after that "Arise, and do not be afraid"</li>
	<li>When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Jesus only</strong></span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial</h3>
<strong>Luke 22:31-34</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

31 And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, <span style="color: #808000;"><strong>Satan has asked for you</strong></span>, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>I have prayed for you</strong></span>, that <span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>your faith should not fail</strong></span>; and when you have <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>returned to Me, strengthen your brethren</strong></span>.”

33 But he said to Him, “Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.”

34 Then He said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.”
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #993366;">I have prayed for you</span> : </strong>Jesus praying for us, seated in the right hand before anything could happen</li>
	<li><strong><span style="color: #33cccc;">Your faith should not fail</span> : </strong>Jesus prayed that Peter's faith should not fail. He would have failed, but his faith didn't</li>
	<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Returned to Me, strengthen your brethren : </strong></span>Jesus Prophesying about Peter's return and strengthening his brethren</li>
	<li>Then Peter proved his self righteousness on the next verse</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Luke 22:54-61</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h4>Peter Denies Jesus, and Weeps Bitterly</h4>
54 Having arrested Him, they led Him and brought Him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed at a distance. 55 Now when they had kindled a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>fire</strong> </span>in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. 56 And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>fire</strong></span>, looked intently at him and said, “This man was also with Him.”

57 But he denied Him, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.”

58 And after a little while another saw him and said, “You also are of them.”

But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”

59 Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.”

60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying!”

Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. 61 And <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>the Lord turned and looked at Peter</strong></span>. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”
<ul>
	<li>Looked with Jesus eyes, doves eyes</li>
	<li>I believe Jesus would have seen him not to provoke his mistake, but to still hold on to his faith, <span style="color: #333399;"><strong>returning to Him and to Strengthen His brethren</strong></span>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Matthew 27:26-29</strong>
<strong> New Living Translation (NLT)</strong>

26 So Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.

<strong>The Soldiers Mock Jesus</strong>

27 Some of the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into their headquarters and called out the entire regiment. 28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. 29 They wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head, and they placed a reed stick in his right hand as a scepter. Then they knelt before him in mockery and taunted, “Hail! King of the Jews!”

<strong>Mark 16:5-7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

5 And entering the tomb, they saw a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>young man</strong></span> clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.

6 But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him. 7 But go, tell His disciples—<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>and Peter</strong></span>—that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you.”
<ul>
	<li>Peter might be crying in a corner</li>
</ul>
<strong>Luke 24:34</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

34 saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>appeared to Simon</strong></span>!”

<strong>John 21:6-7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 And He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.

7 Therefore that <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>disciple whom Jesus loved</strong></span> said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and plunged into the sea</span></strong>.

<strong>John 21:9-17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

9 Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>fire </strong></span>of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.”

11 Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>the net was not broken</strong></span>. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and eat breakfast.” Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, “Who are You?”—knowing that it was the Lord. 13 Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.

14 This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.
<h4>Jesus Restores Peter</h4>
15 So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong> </span>Me more than these?”

He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong> </span>You.”

He said to him, “Feed My lambs.”

16 He said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong> </span>Me?”

He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong> </span>You.”

He said to him, “Tend My sheep.”

17 He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong> </span>Me?” Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, “Do you <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong> </span>Me?”

And he said to Him, “Lord, You know all things; You know that I <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>love</strong> </span>You.”

Jesus said to him, “Feed My sheep.
<ul>
	<li>First two "love" word of Jesus is "Agape"</li>
	<li>Third "love" word of Jesus is "Philia"</li>
	<li>All three "love" word of Peter is "Philia"</li>
	<li>Jesus came down to the level of Peter</li>
	<li>First Jesus feed Jesus then Jesus told Peter to Feed His sheep</li>
	<li>Jesus first feeds us then he tells us to feed others</li>
	<li>Jesus won't let us do something before giving us the ability</li>
</ul>
<h3>Peter Preaches</h3>
<ul>
	<li>3000 People saved on the day of pentecostal</li>
	<li>He was so bold after knowing the love of Christ ( He preached to the people whom he denied before, that He don't know Jesus )</li>
	<li>Finally he started feeding His sheep, strengthening his brethren</li>
	<li>Jesus choose the one who betrayed Him for feeding His sheep. Where sin abounds Grace abounds much more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Becoming a Pillar</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jesus is same yesterday, today and forever.</li>
	<li>Allow yourself to be cultivated</li>
	<li>Sometimes its through correction</li>
	<li>Sometimes it comes through the mouth of some one,  your friends, colleagues, spouse, and even from enemies.</li>
	<li>If you fall, Jesus is there to pick you up, and He will say "when you have returned to me, strengthen your brethren".</li>
