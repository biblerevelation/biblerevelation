<h2>As Christ is so are we in this World</h2>
<strong>1 John 4:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

<span class="text 1John-4-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>as He is, so are we in this world</strong></span>.</span>
<ul>
	<li>God judges us based on Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>Is Jesus holy? Yes, so are we in this world</li>
	<li>Is Jesus blameless? Yes, so are we in this world</li>
	<li>Is Jesus Accepted? Yes, so are we in this world</li>
</ul>
<h2>All that He is, God has set to our account</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Is Jesus Righteous? , <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> Am I Righteous?, because We are righteous in Christ</li>
</ul>
