<h2 class="passage-display"><strong>Double Curse</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Galatians 1:6-9
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span class="text Gal-1-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>the grace of Christ</strong></span>, to a different gospel, </span><span id="en-NKJV-29065" class="text Gal-1-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. </span><span id="en-NKJV-29066" class="text Gal-1-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>accursed</strong></span>. </span><span id="en-NKJV-29067" class="text Gal-1-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>accursed</strong></span>.</span>
<h2><strong>Because</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>God love the People</li>
	<li>And the curse will stop them from Preaching another Gospel</li>
</ul>
