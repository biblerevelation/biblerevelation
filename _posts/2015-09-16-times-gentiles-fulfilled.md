<strong>Luke 21:24</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

24 And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled</strong></span>.
<ul>
	<li>On 16 September 2015, "the times of Gentiles are not fulfilled yet"</li>
	<li>Jews have Jerusalem, but they actually don't have it. ( Reference : JP )</li>
	<li>A time will come for Jews when they will actually haveÂ it.</li>
</ul>
