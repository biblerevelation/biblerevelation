<strong>Proverbs 19:4</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 Wealth makes many friends,
But the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>poor is separated from his friend</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 19:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>All the brothers of the poor hate him</strong></span>;
How much more do his <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>friends go far from him</strong></span>!
He may pursue them with words, yet <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>they abandon him</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 22:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

7 The <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>rich rules over the poor</strong></span>,
And the <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>borrower is servant to the lender</strong></span>.
<h2>But Jesus delivered us from Poverty</h2>
