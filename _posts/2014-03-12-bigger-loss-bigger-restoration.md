<h2>Exodus 22:1</h2>
If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

Lost 1 ox ? Restoration Value is 5 ox
Lost 1 Sheep ? Restoration value is 4 Sheep

<b>Bigger the loss, Bigger the restoration</b>
<h2>Did you loose something big in the past?</h2>
Don't worry. Bigger will be your restoration
