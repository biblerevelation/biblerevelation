<h2>Nebuchadnezzar's Blessings</h2>
<strong>Daniel 4:12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<div class="poetry">
<p class="line"><span id="en-NKJV-21850" class="text Dan-4-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Its leaves <i>were</i> lovely,</span>
<span class="text Dan-4-12">Its fruit abundant,</span>
<span class="text Dan-4-12">And in it <i>was</i> food for all.</span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span class="text Dan-4-12">The beasts of the field found shade under it,</span></strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> <span class="text Dan-4-12">The birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches,</span></strong></span>
<span class="text Dan-4-12"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>And all flesh was fed from it</strong></span>.</span></p>

</div>
<ul>
	<li>God made him king of kings and sovereign.</li>
	<li>Beasts of the field under him</li>
	<li>Birds of the heaven under him</li>
	<li>All flesh was fed from it</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>God didn't give him the seas</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Nebuchadnezzar didn't rule over the fishes of the sea</li>
	<li>Jesus paid the temple tax, which was found from the sea ( in Jesus period )</li>
	<li>sea was reserved for the Perfect Man Jesus</li>
</ul>
<h2>After Nebuchadnezzar restored</h2>
<ul>
	<li>After 7 years Nebuchadnezzar restored back to normal life</li>
	<li>Then he Praised God</li>
	<li>Everything got restored back to him</li>
	<li>Many times Most High God is mentioned in chapter where Nebuchadnezzar appears</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nebuchadnezzar Praises God</h3>
<strong>Daniel 4:34-37</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
