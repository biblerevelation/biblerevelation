<h2>Can you become "Righteous" by Confessing all your sins and Plan to do no sin from now on?</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO</span>

<h3>Proverbs 28:13</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Above verse DOESN'T say that He will become #<strong>Righteous </strong></li>
	<li>Mercy is different from Righteous</li>
	<li>Only Righteous man can enter Heaven.</li>
	<li>But the fact is, you are a sinner not because of your sin.</li>
	<li>And you can't become Righteous by doing Righteous deeds.</li>
</ul>
<div>

<h3>Romans 5:19</h3>
New King James Version (NKJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>19 For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>You became a sinner NOT because of your sins</li>
	<li>You became a sinner because of one man’s disobedience : Adam</li>
	<li>You became Righteous by one Man's Obedience : Jesus</li>
	<li>So its nothing to do with you to become Righteous.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>2 Corinthians 5:21</h3>
New King James Version (NKJV)

</div>
<div>
<blockquote>21 For He made Him who knew no sin <i>to be</i> sin for us, that <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;"><strong>we might become the righteousness of God in Him</strong></span>.</blockquote>
