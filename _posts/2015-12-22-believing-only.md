<h2><strong>NOT Repenting and Believing</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">John 20:31
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span id="en-NKJV-26899" class="text John-20-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>believing</strong> </span>you may have life in His name.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Believing/Believe : Appears 85 times in the Book of John</li>
	<li>Most Printed Gospel Book is the Gospel of John</li>
	<li>"Repent" Word is not used in this whole Gospel of John</li>
	<li>Believing is actually repenting, its basically change of Mind</li>
	<li>Lets not make Repentance as a work towards Salvation</li>
</ul>
