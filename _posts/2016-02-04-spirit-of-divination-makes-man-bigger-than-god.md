<span class="text Acts-16-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Now it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling. </span><span id="en-NKJV-27501" class="text Acts-16-17"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, “<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">These men</span> are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.</strong>” </span><span id="en-NKJV-27502" class="text Acts-16-18"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>And this she did for many days.</span>

<span class="text Acts-16-18">But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And he came out that very hour. </span><span id="en-NKJV-27503" class="text Acts-16-19"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged <i>them</i> into the marketplace to the authorities.</span>
