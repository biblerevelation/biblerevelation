<h2><strong>Repentance doesn't mean you are saved</strong></h2>
<strong><span class="passage-display-bcv">Matthew 27:3-5
</span><span class="passage-display-version">New King James Version (NKJV)</span></strong>

<span class="text Matt-27-3"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was remorseful and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, </span><span id="en-NKJV-24134" class="text Matt-27-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.”</span>

<span class="text Matt-27-4">And they said, “What <i>is that</i> to us? You see <i>to it!</i>”</span>

<span id="en-NKJV-24135" class="text Matt-27-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.</span>
<h2><strong>Height of Presumptuous Pride</strong></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Judas could have waited few more hours, for Jesus.</li>
	<li>Jesus would have hanged for Him, that He didn't need to hang</li>
	<li>People used to say
<ul>
	<li>"I rather die rather than receive forgiveness"</li>
	<li>"I rather pay myself than someone pay for me"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
