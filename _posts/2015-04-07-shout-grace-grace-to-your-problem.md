<strong>Zechariah 4:7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘<span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit</strong></span>,’ says the Lord Almighty.

7 ‘Who are you, O great <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>mountain</strong></span>?
Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain!
And he shall bring forth the capstone
With shouts of “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Grace, grace to it</strong></span>!”’”
