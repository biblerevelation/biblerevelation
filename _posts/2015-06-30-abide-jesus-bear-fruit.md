<h2>The True Vine</h2>
<strong>John 15:1-8</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 “I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.
2 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
3 You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
4 Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>abide in Me</strong></span>.

5 “I am the vine, you are the branches. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>He who <span style="color: #ff00ff;">abides in Me</span></strong></span>, and I in him, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>bears much fruit</strong></span>; for without Me you can do nothing.
6 If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.
8 By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples.
