<h3>Isaiah 61:7</h3>
New King James Version (NKJV)

</div>
<div>

7 Instead of your shame <i>you shall have</i> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>double </strong></span><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>honor</strong></span>,</i>
And <i>instead of</i> confusion they shall rejoice in their portion.
Therefore in their land they shall possess double;
Everlasting joy shall be theirs.
<h2>Example:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>David had many wives.</li>
	<li>Badshiba had more shame</li>
	<li>God Choose Badshiba</li>
	<li>Badshiba's Son Solomon Became the King</li>
	<li>Solomon was Wisest and Richest.</li>
</ul>
