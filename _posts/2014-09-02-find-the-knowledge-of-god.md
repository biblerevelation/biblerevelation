Proverbs 2:1-9

New King James Version (NKJV)
<h3>The Value of Wisdom</h3>
2 My son, if you <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>receive my words</strong></span>,
And <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>treasure my commands</strong></span> within you,
2 So that you <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>incline your ear</strong></span> to wisdom,
And <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>apply your heart</strong></span> to understanding;
3 Yes, if you <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>cry out</strong> </span>for discernment,
And <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>lift up your voice</strong></span> for understanding,
4 If you <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>seek</strong> </span>her as silver,
And <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>search</strong> </span>for her as for hidden treasures;
5 Then you will understand the fear of the Lord,
And <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>find the knowledge of God</strong></span>.
6 For the Lord gives wisdom;
From His mouth come knowledge and understanding;
7 He stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
He is a shield to those who walk uprightly;
8 He guards the paths of justice,
And preserves the way of His saints.
9 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Then you will understand righteousness and justice,</strong></span>
<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Equity and <span style="color: #0000ff;">every</span> good path</strong></span>.
