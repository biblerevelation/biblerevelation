5 If any of you is deficient in wisdom, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff00ff;"><strong>let him ask</strong></span> of the giving God [Who gives] to everyone liberally <i>and</i>ungrudgingly, without reproaching <i>or</i> faultfinding, and it will be given him.

<strong><span style="color: #9f37c7;">First We should realise that we are deficient in wisdom</span></strong>
<h2>How to check whether we are deficient in wisdom or not?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Do you have Happiness?</li>
	<li>Do you have complete Health?</li>
	<li>Do you have Riches?</li>
	<li>Do you have Honor?</li>
	<li>Do you have Pleasantness?</li>
	<li>Do you have Peace?</li>
</ul>
<strong>If the answer for any one of these questions is NO, Then you don't have enough wisdom. </strong>
