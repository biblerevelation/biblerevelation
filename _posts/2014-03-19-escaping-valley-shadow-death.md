<h3>Psalm 23:1-4</h3>
King James Version (KJV)

</div>
<div>

1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

</div>
<h2>When the Lord is "leading" you</h2>
<ul>
	<li>He <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>maketh</strong> </span>me to lie down in Green Pastures</li>
	<li>He <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Leadeth</strong> </span>me beside the still waters</li>
	<li>He <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>restoreth</strong> </span>my soul</li>
	<li>He <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>leadeth</strong> </span>me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake</li>
</ul>
<h2>When You Start "Walking" Yourself</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>walk</strong> </span>through the Valley of the shadow of death</li>
	<li>Shows you are walking yourself without HIS leading</li>
	<li>*You = I</li>
</ul>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Let the Lord lead You, to Escape from the Valley of Shadow of Death</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h2>Note:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>On the Below Psalms wherever the word <strong><span style="color: #000000;">"HE"</span></strong> comes Psalms 23:2-3 : Shows Prosperous, Happy, Resting situation</li>
	<li>Place where the word <strong>"I"</strong> comes Psalms 23:4 : Shows Valley of Shadow of Death Situation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>God is so kind</h2>
Even when you walk yourself, It might be the valley of the SHADOW of death :
<ul>
	<li>Still God is with you always ( Fulfilling His promise for God's Children : "I will never leave you nor forsake you" )
<ul>
	<li>I will fear no evil: for thou <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>art with me</strong></span>;</li>
	<li>thy rod and thy staff <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they comfort me</strong></span>.</li>
	<li>His rod and His staff is NOT for beating us. ( its for comforting us, but for beating the WOLF which comes to deceive us)</li>
	<li>END RESULT : I will fear no evil</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Wait! Wait! still it doesn't say that "Its a valley of Death", It says "Valley of SHADOW of Death".
<ul>
	<li>Shadow means its just a Fake thing to get you scared. (Satan is a deceiver )</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Happy Ending for all situations :)</li>
</ul>
