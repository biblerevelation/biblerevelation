18 A wrathful man stirs up strife,
But <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>he who is slow to anger allays contention</strong></span>.

<strong>Proverbs 14:17</strong>
<strong>New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 A <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>quick-tempered man acts foolishly</strong></span>,
And a man of wicked intentions is hated.

<strong>Proverbs 16:32</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

32 <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty</strong></span>,
And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.
