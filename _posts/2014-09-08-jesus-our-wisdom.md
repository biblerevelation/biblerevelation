<div class="poetry top-1">
<p class="line"><span id="en-NKJV-16625" class="text Prov-8-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>“The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> possessed me at the beginning of His way,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-22">Before His works of old.</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16626" class="text Prov-8-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>I have been established from everlasting,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-23">From the beginning, before there was ever an earth.</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16627" class="text Prov-8-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>When <i>there were</i> no depths I was brought forth,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-24">When <i>there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16628" class="text Prov-8-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>Before the mountains were settled,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-25">Before the hills, I was brought forth;</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16629" class="text Prov-8-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>While as yet He had not made the earth or the fields,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-26">Or the primal dust of the world.</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16630" class="text Prov-8-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>When He prepared the heavens, I <i>was</i> there</strong></span>,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-27">When He drew a circle on the face of the deep,</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16631" class="text Prov-8-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>When He established the clouds above,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-28">When He strengthened the fountains of the deep,</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16632" class="text Prov-8-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>When He assigned to the sea its limit,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-29">So that the waters would not transgress His command,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-29">When He marked out the foundations of the earth,</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16633" class="text Prov-8-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>Then I was beside Him<i> as</i> a master craftsman;</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-30">And I was daily <i>His</i> delight,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-30">Rejoicing always before Him,</span>
<span id="en-NKJV-16634" class="text Prov-8-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Rejoicing in His inhabited world,</span>
<span class="text Prov-8-31">And my delight <i>was</i> with the sons of men.</span></p>
