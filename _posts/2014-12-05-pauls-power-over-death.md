<h2>Paul's power over death</h2>
<h3>Not Accepting Deliverance</h3>
<strong>Hebrews 11:34-35</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

34 quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. 35 Women received their dead raised to life again.

Others were tortured, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>not accepting</strong></span> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>deliverance</strong></span>, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
<ul>
	<li>Implies, deliverance was given. But they didn't accept</li>
	<li><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>deliverance</strong> </span>= 10 Times in new Testament, every time pointing to the Redemption/deliverance of our Lord Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>In the Redemption of Jesus Christ there is protection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paul explaining his power over death</h3>
<strong>Philippians 1:22-26</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

22 But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I cannot tell.
23 For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
24 Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more needful for you.
25 And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith,
26 that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.

<strong>2 Timothy 4:6-7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<h3>Paul’s Valedictory</h3>
6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand.
7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
<h2>Jesus, Power over death</h2>
