<strong>John 17:6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<strong> Jesus Prays for His Disciples</strong>

6 “<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I have manifested <span style="color: #0000ff;">Your name</span> to the men</strong></span> whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.

<strong>Matthew 3:17</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

17 And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, “<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>This is My beloved Son</strong></span>, in whom I am well pleased.”

<strong>John 17:6-12</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>
<strong> Jesus Prays for His Disciples</strong>

6 “<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I have manifested <span style="color: #0000ff;">Your name</span></strong></span> to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. 7 Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You. 8 For I have given to them the words which You have given Me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came forth from You; and they have believed that You sent Me.

9 “I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours. 10 And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them. 11 Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">keep</span> through <span style="color: #0000ff;">Your name</span></strong></span> those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are. 12 While I was with them in the world, <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>I kept them in <span style="color: #0000ff;">Your name</span></strong></span>. Those whom You gave Me I have kept; and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>*keep = Projection</strong></span>

<strong>Matthew 7:11</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

11 If you then, being evil, know how to give <span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>good gifts</strong></span> to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give <strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">good things</span></strong> to those who ask Him!
<h2> Abba Father</h2>
<strong>Mark 14:36</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

36 And He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will.”

<strong>Romans 8:15</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.”

<strong>Galatians 4:6</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

6 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!”

<strong>Galatians 4:1-7</strong>
<strong> New King James Version (NKJV)</strong>

4 Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>child</strong></span>, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, 2 but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. 3 Even so we, when we were <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>children</strong></span>, were in bondage under the elements of the world. 4 But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 5 to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sons</strong></span>.

6 And because you are <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>sons</strong></span>, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” 7 Therefore you are no longer a slave but a <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>son</strong></span>, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
