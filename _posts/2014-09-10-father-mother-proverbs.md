8 My son, hear the instruction of your <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>father</strong></span>,

And chains about your neck.

23 Buy the truth, and do not sell it,
Also wisdom and instruction and understanding.
24 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice,
And he who begets a wise child will delight in him.
25 Let your <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>father</strong> </span>and your <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>mother</strong> </span>be glad,
And let her who bore you rejoice.

But a companion of harlots wastes his wealth.
